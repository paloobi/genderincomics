Naltor's native denizens are genetically inclined to be precognitives, with the ability to see into the future. At a young age, Nura became recognized as the most powerful precog among her people, more able to dream with peculiar accuracy, or see a few moments into the future while awake, than any other. Nura's exceptional beauty often hid the fact that she was also exceptionally bright, and once she reached adulthood, she had already mastered advanced Naltorian science, putting her among the galaxy's intellectual elite. Nura eventually left Naltor to act on one her visions in which she foresaw the death of several members of the <a href=\"\/legion-of-super-heroes\/4060-19241\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\">Legion of Super-Heroes<\/a> on a mission in space. Determined to prevent their deaths, she introduced herself to the Legion using the code name of Dream Girl.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p style=\"\">Dream Girl was created in 1964 by writer <a href=\"\/edmond-hamilton\/4040-42401\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42401\">Edmond Hamilton<\/a> and artist <a href=\"\/john-forte\/4040-7532\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7532\">John Forte<\/a>, first appearing in <a href=\"\/adventure-comics\/4050-3105\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3105\">Adventure Comics<\/a> #310. She became the sixth female member of the Legion of Super-Heroes and their 20th member overall. As her code name would suggest, Dream Girl was portrayed as the most glamorous member of the Legion, and she was envisioned as a <a href=\"..\/..\/marilyn-monroe\/29-16582\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marilyn Monroe<\/a>-like beauty complete with platinum-blonde hair, revealing silver costumes, high heels, and a star-shaped birthmark on her right cheek. Despite her looks, Dream Girl was also conceived to be one of the Legion's most intelligent and capable members.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><h3><b>Original Continuity: New Earth<\/b><\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1644352\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29837\/1644352-dreamgirl_lightle.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"1.4321705426357\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29837\/1644352-dreamgirl_lightle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1644352\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/29837\/1644352-dreamgirl_lightle.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Dream Girl (classic 70's costume)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Nura knew from her vision that several of the Legionnaires would face death in an explosion in space if they remained members of the team. At one of the Legion's open try-outs, Nura introduced herself as Dream Girl, gaining the attention of the male Legionnaires and the ire of the female Legionnaires. One Legionnaire fell in love with her at first sight, <a href=\"\/starman\/4005-1260\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1260\">Star Boy<\/a>. The male Legionnaires voted her in to the team. Immediately, Dream Girl studied the Legion Constitution, to discover ways to expel the doomed Legionnaires from the team. One by one, she sabotaged them, including <a href=\"\/lightning-lass\/4005-30997\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30997\">Lightning Lass<\/a>, who had her electrical powers seemingly removed by Nura's Naltorian science. The vision Nura had, turned out to be a vision of a test the Legion was doing with crash test dummies that looked like the Legionnaires. Dream Girl also revealed that Lightning Lass' powers had changed from electrical control to the nullification of gravity.<\/p><p style=\"\">Once the truth of Dream Girl's scheme came out, the Legionnaires invited Dream Girl to stay on the team because she had their best interests in mind. Dream Girl declined the invitation, deciding instead to get more training in her abilities. Dream Girl joined the <a href=\"\/legion-of-substitute-heroes\/4060-47111\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47111\">Legion of Substitute Heroes<\/a> so she would have time to practice and perfect her visions. Later, after Star Boy lost his kryptonian-level powers, and followed her to the Substitute Legion and started their romance. Finally, when it appeared that <a href=\"\/supergirl\/4005-2351\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\">Supergirl<\/a> and <a href=\"\/superman\/4005-1807\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superboy<\/a> were leaving the Legion of Super-Heroes, Star Boy and Dream Girl rejoined the team.<\/p><p style=\"\">With her stunning pinup-girl looks and figure, a flirty swimsuit-like costume (which she wore even prior to the Legion's sexy-costume era of the 70's), and boldly confident personality, the male Legionnaires completely stopped noticing the other female members on the team, and the female Legionnaires soon grew jealous and resentful. Never one to back down from a challenge, Dream Girl made an effort to reach out to her female teammates, gradually winning them over and befriending them with her natural charm and charisma.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1982181\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83063\/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"2.6036585365854\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:260.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83063\/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1982181\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83063\/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83063\/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Dream Girl (Earth-247)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Nura claimed that her name was Nura Schappin, changing her surname to Nal because, as she put it, \"It just says I'm from Naltor y'know.\" She also claimed to have been the first precognitive to be born on Naltor in seven generations, a claim that was later contradicted by other post-<i>Zero Hour<\/i> Legion stories. For most of this continuity's duration, Nura was not a Legionnaire, although she was still Star Boy's girlfriend. Additionally, she suffered from narcolepsy, falling unconscious whenever she had a vision. She was no longer the sister of <a href=\"\/black-witch\/4005-30998\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30998\">Mysa<\/a>, who was completely unrelated to her in this continuity. Eventually, Nura gained Legion membership under the codename Dreamer. Unlike other continuities her Legion costume featured a cape, as well as a diamond-shaped \"cleavage window\" in the front.<\/p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1534216\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29837\/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"2.141975308642\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:214.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29837\/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1534216\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/29837\/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/29837\/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Dream Girl (Earth-Prime)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Dream Girl had a more disconnected and \"spaced out\" personality in this continuity, since her precognition often interfered with her perception of current reality and she had trouble differentiating between the two. She wore a midriff-baring costume with a silver top and black leggings. In her first action as a Legionnaire she stopped an assassination attempt on the United Planets delegates by a spy. <a href=\"..\/..\/brainiac-5\/29-1255\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5<\/a> had compiled data for three days and sent Dream Girl, <a href=\"..\/..\/karate-kid\/29-1269\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karate Kid<\/a>, and <a href=\"..\/..\/element-lad\/29-1263\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad<\/a> to stop the assassin. The Legionnaires looked like they were beaten, until Karate Kid woke Dream Girl from a daydream and she took down the assassin down with ease, saying that she thought they had already defeated him. Afterwards, Brainiac 5 announced that Dream Girl's precog power frustrated him to no end because there was no rationality to it and it was not scientific. Dream Girl then interrupted Brainy, talking about a conversation they had not had yet, frustrating him even further. Later, Dream Girl, Karate Kid, <a href=\"..\/..\/shadow-lass\/29-1261\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow Lass<\/a> and Brainiac 5 were all sent to Dream Girl's home planet of Naltor to investigate why no one under the age of 18 was able to sleep.<\/p><p style=\"\">Brainiac 5 eventually realized that he was in love with her, right before she was killed in the battle that destroyed most of the Legion Headquarters. He stopped her soul from escaping, and she went to live only in Brainiac's mind while he tried to figure out a way to restore her body.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2120994\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/92932\/2120994-dg11.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 278px\" data-ratio=\"1.1294964028777\" data-width=\"278\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:112.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/92932\/2120994-dg11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2120994\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/92932\/2120994-dg11.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/92932\/2120994-dg11.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Dream Girl (current continuity)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">With the \"retroboot,\" Dream Girl and the Legion returned to being very much like the original team prior to the Five Year Gap, with a few differences. At the beginning of the story arc several members of the Legion (including the original Dream Girl in her classic silver costume) mysteriously appeared in the 21st century. Other Legionnaires were scattered and trapped in different places throughout the universe. Dream Girl was captured and imprisoned by the nightmarish villain <a href=\"..\/..\/doctor-destiny\/29-10453\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Destiny<\/a> in <a href=\"..\/..\/arkham-asylum\/34-31682\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arkham Asylum<\/a>, where her precognitive powers were manipulated into giving her horrific illusions. She was rescued by the <a href=\"..\/..\/justice-society-of-america\/65-27589\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justice Society<\/a> and <a href=\"\/justice-league-of-america\/4060-31815\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">Justice League<\/a>, and was reunited with her longtime love Thom Kallor (formerly Star Boy), who had been flung back in time to become the new <a href=\"..\/..\/starman\/29-7646\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starman<\/a>. In this revised history the relationship between the two was more tragic, since Starman suffered mental damage after being hurtled back through time unprepared. She felt terribly for him and believed that the 21st-century methods of treating his mental illness were barbaric. Dream Girl has since established a connection to the realm of '<a href=\"\/the-dreaming\/4020-55857\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55857\">The Dreaming<\/a>,' further enhancing her precognitive powers. She also correctly predicted the threat of <a href=\"..\/..\/superman-prime\/29-40756\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy-Prime<\/a> in <a href=\"..\/..\/final-crisis\/39-51642\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Final Crisis<\/a>: <a href=\"..\/..\/final-crisis-legion-of-three-worlds\/49-22674\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Three Worlds<\/a>, the recent storyline which united all three versions of the Legion together. After the <a href=\"\/last-stand-of-new-krypton\/4045-56041\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56041\">war<\/a> with <a href=\"\/new-krypton\/4020-56084\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56084\">New Krypton<\/a> in the 21st century, Dream Girl was able to bring Star Boy back home to the 31st century to get him the medical treatment he needed.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3><b>Original Continuity: New Earth<\/b><\/h3><h4>Romance with Star Boy<\/h4><p style=\"\">Though Nura continued to receive constant attention from the unattached male Legionnaires (and even some of the attached ones), <a href=\"..\/..\/star-boy\/29-1260\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Star Boy<\/a> (Thom Kallor) was the one who eventually managed to capture her heart. Nura became very close to him and she was romantically involved with Star Boy for many years. Dream Girl spent several years as someone who needed to be rescued, partly due to her effective but non-combative power. Not wanting to be a liability she trained intensively in hand-to-hand combat in order to better serve the team on the field. She was a quick study and became a highly skilled martial artist, second on the team in unarmed combat to only <a href=\"..\/..\/karate-kid\/29-1269\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karate Kid.<\/a> Her precognitive power to foresee an opponent's moves before they even made them further enhanced her effectiveness as a fighter.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4>Leaving The Legion<\/h4><p style=\"\">At one point Nura took a temporary leave from the team, since she believed she had initially joined under false pretenses. She had foreseen the deaths of some Legionnaires while dreaming and proceeded to get those Legionnaires expelled from the Legion in order to save their lives. During this time she joined the <a href=\"..\/..\/legion-of-substitute-heroes\/65-47111\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Substitute Heroes<\/a> until she reunited with Star Boy, who had been previously expelled from the Legion for accidentally killing Nura's former lover, a Naltorian named Kenz Nahor, in self-defense after Nahor attempted to kill Star Boy out of jealousy.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4>Leader of the Legion<\/h4><p style=\"\">Dream Girl soon rejoined the Legion and continued serving as a highly valued member. After <a href=\"..\/..\/lightning-lad\/29-1253\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightning Lad<\/a>'s term as Legion leader went horribly awry, the team decided it was time to elect a new leader, and Dream Girl announced that she was officially running for the position. The other candidates initially scoffed at the idea of the Legion's glamor girl winning the job, until they realized to their dismay that she would not have announced her candidacy had she not already foreseen herself winning. Sure enough, Dream Girl was elected leader, becoming only the second female Legionnaire ever to do so (after <a href=\"..\/..\/saturn-girl\/29-1273\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl<\/a>).<\/p><p style=\"\">Shortly after she assumed leadership the Legion was faced with one of the most dire challenges in their history -- the <a href=\"..\/..\/great-darkness-saga\/39-40773\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Darkness Saga<\/a>. The ancient super-villain <a href=\"..\/..\/darkseid\/29-2349\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darkseid<\/a> attempted to conquer the whole of the United Planets. He very nearly succeeded, but the Legion, with Dream Girl's able leadership, finally managed to thwart him after an epic and costly struggle. During this time Nura's sister, Mysa Nal, arrived to aid the team with her mastery of the magical arts. Afterwards Mysa became a Legionnaire, calling herself the <a href=\"..\/..\/white-witch\/29-30998\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White Witch<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Though Dream Girl again ran for leader the following term, she lost out to Element Lad. Star Boy made no effort to hide his satisfaction about this result. During her stint as leader, their relationship had suffered. After Star Boy left the team to become planetary champion of his home planet, <a href=\"\/xanthu\/4020-56504\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56504\">Xanthu<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4>The Universo Project<\/h4><p style=\"\">Dream Girl became one of the first Legion members to demonstrate sufficient willpower to utilize her Legion Flight Ring on an object other than herself, effectively giving her the ability of telekinesis. She later was one of four Legionnaires singled out by <a href=\"\/universo\/4005-22717\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22717\">Universo<\/a> as the most dangerous obstacles in his attempt to take over the Earth (along with Saturn Girl, Brainiac 5, and Chameleon Boy). The four were captured and held prisoner with their memories suppressed. Saturn Girl eventually regained her memory and helped her teammates engineer an escape, after which they turned the tables on Universo. It was assumed that they were isolated as the most dangerous because they were the smartest Legionnaires, but it also could have been that those four had the most resistance to Universo's mind control -- even more than the Legion's (then current) telepath, <a href=\"\/tellus\/4005-30996\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30996\">Tellus<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4>Mind-controlled by Atmos<\/h4><p style=\"\">When the ruler of Xanthu (Star Boy's home planet) asked Thom to be their resident hero since their champion <a href=\"\/atmos\/4005-28222\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28222\">Atmos<\/a> had gone missing, Star Boy reluctantly had to take his leave from the Legion and Nura. While Star Boy was away, Atmos turned up during a Legion mission and Nura inexplicably found herself intensely attracted to him. To the surprise of her teammates, she broke up her long-distance relationship with Star Boy and jumped into a romance with Atmos. The truth later became apparent to her that Atmos was somehow using his mental powers to take over her emotions and sap her will. Furious at being so manipulated, she used her own formidable willpower to slowly build up a tolerance to Atmos' mind-sapping powers. She kept this a secret from her erstwhile lover until one night when Atmos had fallen asleep. She regained enough control over herself to activate her Legion flight ring alarm and knocked Atmos out cold with one punch the moment he woke up. Free of Atmos' influence, Nura immediately went back to her true love Thom.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4>Five Years Later<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/80419\/1888499-dg30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1888499\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 103px\" data-ratio=\"2.3495145631068\" data-width=\"103\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:235.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/80419\/1888499-dg30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1888499\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/80419\/1888499-dg30.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/80419\/1888499-dg30.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>High Seer (Five Years Later)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After the devastation of the <a href=\"\/the-magic-wars\/4045-56080\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56080\">Magic Wars<\/a>, Legion continuity was re-started after the period known as the Five Year Gap. The galactic economy had collapsed and Earth's government became very hostile towards the Legion. Nura left the team and made her return to Naltor to become its High Seer. She steered Naltor successfully through the troubled times, and under her leadership her world became one of the most stable economies in the United Planets. But Nura felt alone and missed Star Boy terribly, so she went through a series of relationships with several men during this time. In early 2996, after a flash of light that seemed to indicate some sort of time flux, Dream Girl joined her former teammates on Earth, and just before the destruction of the time line, she shared a kiss with her old flame Star Boy before they were wiped out of existence due to the <a href=\"..\/..\/zero-hour\/39-40782\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour<\/a> event.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime<\/h3><h4>Guiding the Legion<\/h4><p style=\"\">On Naltor, the Legionnaires brought a crazed teen before the high council and Dream Girl demanded to know what was being done to fix the problem. She also explained that without dreams, Naltorians could not interpret their visions and would eventually lose their precognitive abilities. The high council of Nltro claimed that the lack of sleep was a disease and not to worry, since it would work itself out. After it was discovered that it was actually the adults committing the crime against the children, Brainiac 5 took off, leaving the other three Legionnaires to fight the Precommandos (Precog Cops). The cops lay a beating on Karate Kid and Shadow Lass, until Dream Girl distracted the police so that they focused their attention solely on her. Taking advantage of the distraction, her teammates took the cops down. Dream Girl knew that more precogs were on the way, but she also knew that there was something the high council did not want the kids to see. She tried to get Karate Kid to knock her out but he refused, so Shadow Lass blindsided her with a mean right hand. Dream Girl then viewed the Destruction of the Universe by an unknown enemy and his army. When she woke up she said one word... 'Brainy'. Dream Girl lead the team to the public service broadcaster where they found Brainy \"attacking the problem\" as he put. It came down to Dream Girl having to choose either to let the youth know what she saw and how little time they had left, or security and comfort. She chose the former.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4>Relationship with Brainiac 5<\/h4><p style=\"\">When the team returned to Legion headquarters, Brainiac 5 explained to Dream Girl how all it would take was one person, one casualty to have the willpower to break destiny; that the universe was more unpredictable than they gave it credit for and her visions did not have to be infallible. Dream Girl told him he would feel differently once they were married.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4>Foreseeing Her Own Death<\/h4><p style=\"\">After this the Legion's true enemy was revealed: The terrorist group called <a href=\"..\/..\/terra-firma\/65-47457\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Firma<\/a>, lead by the super-powered <a href=\"..\/..\/elysion\/29-1274\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elysion<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/lemnos\/29-1268\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lemnos<\/a>. Terra Firma attacked the planet Helegyn. During this attack Dream girl had a vision but could not see past one hour; after that, all she saw was black. After Elysion was captured, Dream Girl took out her frustrations on him. As she did so, Dream Girl expressed faith, something unheard of for precogs. Brainiac 5 and Dream Girl had a romantic moment while he tried to figure out her problem. Then Terra Firma made their move, just as Dream Girl had foreseen. They suicide-bombed Legion Tower and the plaza where teens had gathered to support the Legion. Brainiac 5 and Dream Girl headed there. Elysion escaped and, using his earth-controlling powers, brought down Legion Tower on top of everyone around. Amid the chaos, the answer to Dream Girl's problem was answered... she could not see past her own death. Dream Girl was crushed in the rubble of Legion Tower.<\/p><h4>Return to Life<\/h4><p style=\"\">After she died, Brainiac 5 activated his force field around her dug-out body, which was still in remarkably good condition despite its physical death. Later it was revealed that Brainiac 5 had placed Dream Girl's body in stasis and was using a captured Lemnos try to bring her back to life. At the end of the story arc, he was shown to be successful: Nura's consciousness was transferred into a newly cloned version of her original body with her powers and sight fully restored. In the final issue of this continuity, the happy pair announced to the rest of the team their plans to get married.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth<\/h3><h4>The New 52<\/h4><p style=\"\">The efforts of DC to revitalize its titles led to the New 52 reboot of the universe, in which all DC titles were relaunched simultaneously. The Legion of Super Heroes reverted to a close analogue of their original continuity prior to any of reboots, but it remains to be seen the extent of any changes between the old series and new. Dream Girl and Star Boy are once again an official couple, though she also appears to have a strong relationship with <a href=\"\/brainiac-5\/4005-1255\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\">Brainiac 5<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities<\/h2><h3>Precognition<\/h3><p style=\"\">Dream Girl has the ability to see the future in dreams and visions. This is a power shared by all natives of her home planet Naltor, but Nura's ability to do so is considered to be among the strongest of her race. In addition to the long-range precognition of her dreams, Dream Girl also has the power of short term precognition when in a conscious state, allowing her to see a few seconds into the future at any given moment.<\/p><p style=\"\"><strong>Unarmed Combat<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"\">Because of her passive power, Dream Girl's early portrayal was a damsel-in-distress who could be easily defeated and captured by enemies, obliging her teammates to rescue her. She resolved to change this and spent long hours with the Legion's ultimate martial arts master, Karate Kid, who gave her extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. She quickly became one of his most gifted students, to the point where she is now the second-most skilled martial artist on the team. Her fighting ability is greatly enhanced by her power to see seconds into the future, which allows her to predict her opponent's moves even before they make them and map out a battle before it actually begins. This makes her a very formidable tactician, and she is able to successfully combat enemies physically far stronger than her, such as the <a href=\"\">Persuader<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Intellect<\/h3><p style=\"\">Nura also possesses a genius-level intellect, and has mastered the highly advanced principles of Naltorian Science. She is one of the few Legionnaires to have received a compliment from Brainiac 5 for intellectual prowess. Because of her great intellect she was chosen for capture by the villain Universo, since he regarded her as one of the Legion's four biggest threats to his domination of Earth (the others being <a href=\"\/saturn-girl\/4005-1273\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1273\">Saturn Girl<\/a>, <a href=\"\/chameleon-boy\/4005-5945\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5945\">Chameleon Boy<\/a>, and Brainiac 5).<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h3>Equipment<\/h3><p style=\"\">As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Dream Girl possesses a <a href=\"..\/..\/legion-flight-ring\/18-47353\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring<\/a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring. Dream Girl has also employed the ring in various ways unknown to other Legionnaires. Using her great willpower, Nura has used the flight ring to levitate and move other nearby objects as though she has telekinesis.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Other Versions<\/h2><h3>Five Years Later: Batch SW6<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1982222\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83063\/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"1.7405303030303\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:174.1%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83063\/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1982222\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83063\/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83063\/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Dream Girl (Batch SW6)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The devastation of the <a href=\"\/the-magic-wars\/4045-56080\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56080\">Magic Wars<\/a> caused original Legion continuity to jump ahead five years in what is now known as the Five Year Gap.

As a Legionnaire, Tinya's unique phasing abilities made her a crucial contact between Earth and the Phantom Zone. Tinya and Jo Nah (<a href=\"..\/..\/ultra-boy\/29-1267\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultra Boy<\/a>) became one of the earliest Legion couples. Tinya was so taken with Jo that she was willing to aid him even when it was thought he had betrayed the Legion. The two have since formed of the Legion's most enduring couples. Phantom Girl became a founding member of the Legion Espionage Squad and became best friends with Tasmia Mallor (<a href=\"\/shadow-lass\/4005-1261\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1261\">Shadow Lass<\/a>), and Tinya and Jo would often double-date with Tasmia and her boyfriend <a href=\"\/mon-el\/4005-21508\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21508\">Mon-el<\/a>. After an incident when Ultra Boy was thought dead, Tinya mourned greatly. She was later ecstatic to discover he was alive but had simply had amnesia. Tinya eventually became the most senior Legionnaire, and has served in the Legion without any absences longer than anyone else in history. As a founder of the Legion Espionage Squad, Tinya displayed remarkable leadership qualities. Despite this, she remained the longest-serving Legionnaire never to be elected as Legion leader (until very recently).<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Phantom Girl's original costume consisted of white tights and a cape, with a stylized black 'P' on her chest.

Tinya was again one of the earliest Legion recruits, though in this continuity she took the code name <b>Apparition<\/b> rather than Phantom Girl. Bgztl was now an actual planet in the United Planets, rather than a dimensional neighbor, and Tinya's mother, <a href=\"\/winema-wazzo\/4005-12817\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12817\">Winema<\/a>, served as Bgztl's ambassador. Tinya lived with her mother on Earth with no family, having been born to her mother and a drifter. Tinya and Winema were both unaware her father was a Carggite and that Tinya was as well. When she was born and Winema was asleep, he stole two of the three Tinya bodies and sold them off to the Luck Lords. Ignorant of this, Tinya was raised with all the spoils of Winema's career. Apparition joined the Legion after she helped foil an assassination plot at a UP conference, the first recruit alongside Triad. While a Legionnaire, she often argued with her mother. This was especially so when Tinya started to fall in love with the unbecoming Ultra Boy of the <a href=\"\/workforce\/4060-47189\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47189\">Workforce<\/a>. The two dated in secret and professed their love to each other just as a Daxamite terrorist fried them with heat vision, killing Tinya. She was buried on Earth and mourned by the Legion, Ultra Boy, and her mother.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Apparition wore a costume similar to Phantom Girl's original outfit, but with a thick black stripe down the middle rather than a 'P' on her chest.

Tinya Wazzo again went by the Phantom Girl codename and was a member of the Legion. She was a fan of old Earth comic books and had the biggest collection among the heroes. Bgtzl was now a world that was slightly out of phase with Earth and her phasing ability was actually her transporting herself between the planets. She was able to pass back and forth these worlds at will and could often be seen in both, regardless of what she might be doing in one. This led to strange situations and misunderstandings with her teammates. A friend and teammate, <a href=\"\">Karate Kid<\/a>, had shown interest in Tinya. But when he finally got the courage to profess his feelings to Phantom Girl, he discovered that she was already in a relationship with a boy from her own dimension who was ironically breaking up with Tinya at the time.

At long last, Phantom Girl was finally elected by readers to serve as leader of the Legion.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Phantom Girl's current costume is a reworked version of her classic \"portholes &amp; bell-bottoms\" costume from the 70's, though it is now sleeveless and more form-fitting.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Original Continuity: New Earth<\/h3><h4>Five Years Later<\/h4><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Following the cataclysmic events of the <a href=\"..\/..\/the-magic-wars\/39-56080\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars<\/a>, Legion continuity jumped ahead five years in what is known as the \"Five Year Gap.\" Ultra Boy finally proposed to Tinya, after which she boarded a shuttle to Bgztl to shop for a wedding dress. But a mechanical error tragically caused the ship to explode, apparently killing Phantom Girl. Her death would leave Ultra Boy in mourning for years. She was once thought to have survived the explosion by being hurled backwards in time (see <b>Alternate Versions<\/b> below), though this turned out to be a duplicate of Tinya rather than Tinya herself.

Only Jo and her mother could initially see her, but soon <a href=\"..\/..\/saturn-girl\/29-1273\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl<\/a> detected her and clued the rest of the Legionnaires in telepathically. While stranded in the 20th century, an encounter with <a href=\"..\/..\/deadman\/29-5690\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deadman<\/a> and a mystic entity made Apparition's spirit visible to all onlookers. Shortly thereafter, Tinya and Jo were secretly married. While in the past, Apparition encountered the heroine Phase. The pair were absorbed into their touchstones when they came near each other and learned Phase was actually one of Tinya's missing bodies, having been lost in time after being sold into slavery. Pulling together to save Ultra Boy, the girls merged for the first time and Apparition was restored to a physical form. Apparition then returned with the Legion to the 30th century and reunited with her mother.<\/p><h4>Pregnancy<\/h4><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Tinya was on a mission in deep space when the Blight attacked, crippling space travel and forcing Tinya to spend a month in a shuttle just to return to Earth. There, she found Ultra Boy had been blighted and aided the Legion in freeing Earth. Subsequently, Ultra Boy and several other Legionnaires were lost in a spatial rift and presumed dead. The Legion disbanded and Apparition, discovering she was pregnant after Jo had \"died,\" fled to his homeworld of <a href=\"..\/..\/rimbor\/34-57117\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rimbor<\/a> to start a new life. Her Bgztlian pregnancy lasted a year, where she came under the protection of <a href=\"..\/..\/timber-wolf\/29-3619\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Timber Wolf<\/a> and his Wolf Pack gang. She had a healthy phase birth on the day the lost Legionnaires were revealed to be alive. Apparition resolved to rejoin the Legion with her newborn son, Cub, and Timber Wolf accompanied her to protect her. She learned that Ultra Boy had an affair with Saturn Girl during their year of being lost in space, but ultimately forgave him. The pair dealt with their son's rapid aging until Earth-247 was destroyed, leaving Apparition and her Legion the sole survivors as they were lost in the timestream. Tinya was equipped with a utility belt with rations and a transuit that allowed her to breathe in space.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h4>The Missing Body<\/h4><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29837\/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-846063\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.14\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29837\/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-846063\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/29837\/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/29837\/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Phase and Apparition reunited (Earth-247)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Late in Earth-247 continuity, it was revealed that Tinya's father was actually a Carggite (teammate <a href=\"\/duplicate-girl\/4005-1262\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1262\">Triplicate Girl<\/a>'s race), with the ability to split into three separate bodies, and Tinya had inherited this ability at birth. However, her father was also an chronic gambler who owed a fortune in gambling debts, so when Tinya was just a baby, he made a deal with the mysterious Luck Lords to sell off two of her bodies in order to pay off his debts. Her mother Winema never knew that Tinya's father was a Carggite and never knew about Tinya's other two bodies. One of Tinya's bodies was sold into slavery and her fate remained unknown.

Tinya helped Projectra cope with the recent death of her parents by reading her ancient comic books from the 20th century, and politely tolerated Projectra's bratty and abusive behavior towards her. Tinya's closeness to Projectra enabled her to learn that Projectra secretly blamed the Legion for her parents' death and the loss of her family fortune. Upon further investigation, Tinya discovered that Projectra was plotting to destroy the Legion in revenge. But before Tinya could alert the Legion, Projectra found her out and savagely attacked her. Tinya initially defended herself by entering her phased state, but Projectra used her powers of illusion to trick Tinya into becoming tangible again and then beat Tinya nearly to death. Her comatose, disfigured body was discovered just in time by <a href=\"\/timber-wolf\/4005-3619\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3619\">Timber Wolf<\/a>, who activated Tinya's alarm beacon. Tinya was brought to the Legion infirmary, where she began to recover, but Projectra then used her powers to alter Tinya's memories before she could tell the Legion what had happened. This plotline was left unresolved when Threeboot continuity was ended by Infinite Crisis.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><h3>Intangibility<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Phantom Girl has the ability to turn intangible by shifting her existence partially or fully into the extra-dimensional space known as the <a href=\"\/phantom-zone\/4020-42370\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42370\">Phantom Zone<\/a>. When fully phasing out of reality, Tinya is able to enter the Phantom Zone of her own accord. She has also shown the ability to draw people into the Phantom Zone with her. Tinya is the only member of her race known to be able to phase herself completely through the Phantom Zone and onto Earth, which shares extra-dimensional space with her home planet of Bgztl.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While phased, Phantom Girl is immune to physical harm, can maneuver through solid objects, and float weightlessly like a ghost under her own power. Phantom Girl has demonstrated the ability to phase with split-second timing as well as the ability to phase certain parts of her body selectively, feats very few Bgztlians can accomplish. In her \"ghost\" incarnation she has demonstrated the ability to disrupt the workings of electronic devices by moving through them while half-phased.<\/p><h3>Hand-to-Hand Combat<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Phantom Girl has mastered a Bgztlian form of martial arts that takes full advantage of her ability to phase in and out of tangibility during combat. Her skill at striking opponents while solid and becoming intangible when they attack has made her a formidable fighter. By partially materializing a portion of herself (usually her arm\/fist) inside her opponent's body she can also deliver a severe shock to their system, though she rarely resorts to this form of attack.<\/p><h3>Equipment<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As a member of the Legion of Super Heroes, Phantom Girl possesses a <a href=\"..\/..\/legion-flight-ring\/18-47353\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring<\/a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.<\/p><h2>Other Versions<\/h2><h3>20th Century: Phase<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>For further details<\/b>: <a href=\"\/phase\/4005-12983\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12983\">Phase<\/a><\/p><figure style=\"width: 300px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8842\/505628-tinyafront44.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-505628\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4333333333333\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8842\/505628-tinyafront44.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-505628\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8842\/505628-tinyafront44.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8842\/505628-tinyafront44.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Phase (Enya Wazzo)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After Tinya Wazzo apparently died when her starship exploded (following the Five Year Gap), she seemingly reappeared in the 20th century, but with no memories of her life in the 30th century.

It was later revealed in Earth-247 continuity that the original Tinya was half-Carggite (Triplicate Girl's race), meaning that she could split into three separate bodies but had lost the ability because one of her bodies was missing in the timestream. Phase, also known as Enya Wazzo and originally believed to be Tinya's time-lost cousin, turned out to be that missing body. Upon learning of this, the 30th-century Tinya traveled back in time to find Enya.

The Legion made Tasmia a temporary Legionnaire during the ensuing battle, and together they defeated the Fatal Five. Afterward Tasmia was offered full membership into the Legion and she accepted, taking the code name of Shadow Lass. She became the first Legionnaire in history to win membership directly through battle.

At birth she was taken from her mother, the then-current Champion, in a bid to ensure that no single accident or attack could ever claim both of them, and saw her only seven times during her lifetime, all at solemn ceremonies in which they were forbidden to speak. As she grew up, she was raised by priests and was trained in combat and drilled in the order of her bloodline. She loved it. Finally, one day, her mother was killed in battle and she was brought before the leaders of Talok VIII's twelve tribes - the only time they would ever congregate peacefully - before entering the Shadow Cave, where she met the spirits of her mother and the other prior Champions. After they chastised her for never wondering how her mother died, she took to heart their counsel to protect Talok VIII (but not their warning against egocentrism) and they told her to Go In Power. On leaving the cave, she found the inhabitants of Talok VIII on their knees, waiting for a sign - which she provided when she let the Shadows loose. After that, she became the Champion, using her position to give orders to leaders and priests, all in maintenance of the Old Ways. This lasted until the ship came. The United Planets ship came in peace, proselytizing the benefits of U.P. membership. Sent to greet the \"invaders,\" she understood none of it , and she set about dismantling the \"hideous\" ship and crew. Despite their best efforts, she caused an explosion that caused the ship's landing gear to collapse. After that, the priests (who had already been harboring doubts about the \"zealot\") kept her drugged until UP entry negotiations were complete. Profoundly disturbed by the cultural influx and Talok's \"captitulance,\"she was eventually \"dismissed\" and told to study the galaxy to \"open her mind.\"<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Umbra's costume drew on the character's earlier and sexier 1970's look, consisting of a skimpy black bikini with a revealing open 'slash' pattern, long black boots and gloves, and a cape.

To find out what had happened, she finally returned to Talok VIII for the first time since her dismissal. There she found a planet completely cloaked in shadow, and a shadow which knocked her out. Shadow Maven, one of the priests who had trained her, found her and told her that after her loss in the rift, they had believed her dead and managed to empower her \"distant cousin Grev\" with the shadows through the use of technology, and had him cloak the planet completely, withdrawing from the United Planets. Angry at the thought that just as she had accepted the galaxy Talok had turned away from it, she went to confront Grev. The shadow gradually leeched back to her, until she split open the suit Grev used to control the shadow - and found a withered corpse inside, as he had been unable to withstand being a conduit for the Shadow, while the suit ran on its last programmed directives. She cast the shadow-cloak from the planet, and spent some time there before returning to the Legion.<\/p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth<\/h3><h4>Affair with Earth-Man<\/h4><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At the start of current continuity Shadow Lass appeared to have broken up with Mon-El, with no reason truly given.

When Tasmia found out that Mon-El was chosen to be a <a href=\"\/green-lantern\/4015-41148\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41148\">Green Lantern<\/a>, she felt a bit uneasy about it. However Mon-El told her that even though his part of the Corp, the Legion and Earth will always be his family. Earth-Man was later killed in action, and by the end of the latest Legion title it appeared that Tasmia and Mon-El were taking steps to patch up their relationship.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><h3>Darkness Manipulation<\/h3><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/92932\/2121021-sl07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2121021\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1505922165821\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.1%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/92932\/2121021-sl07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2121021\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/92932\/2121021-sl07.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/92932\/2121021-sl07.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Darkness Manipulation<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shadow Lass is able to tap into an unknown and ancient connection to the source of darkness in the universe. She received the gift when she visited the ancient spirits of her ancestral caves. The intense darkness that she creates can engulf large areas of space almost instantly, causing an absolute absence of light which very few (like <a href=\"..\/..\/projectra\/29-6797\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sensor Girl<\/a>) can penetrate with their vision. Shadow Lass is able to control the shape of her darkness, from a large amorphous cloud to a tight beam of concentrated shadows.

Shadow Lass is completely immune to the effects of the darkness she generates and is able to see perfectly through it.<\/p><h3>Unarmed Combat<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shadow Lass is a superb athlete and hand-to-hand combatant who learned great fighting skill from her native people as their chosen champion.

However, Luornu was unique among Carggites in that each of her duplicates exhibited distinctly different personalities. Unfortunately Luornu suffered an unhappy home life; at a young age she was abandoned by her father and her mother became an alcoholic. Luornu was then raised by her grandmother who encouraged the differences between the Luornu's separated bodies. But after her grandmother passed away, Luornu fell into the custody of a Carggite government that frowned upon non-synchronized behavior. Lu was placed in a special institution, almost like an insane asylum, to 'deprogram' the individuality out of Lu's selves. Feeling tortured, she managed to escape and came across the third richest sentient in the world, R.J. Brande. Brande took pity on Luornu and took her in.

Nam'Lor refused to do so and finally determined that his own 'Hyber-Aura' (which was the source of his powers) had adversely affected Luornu's mind and caused her to become evil, so he abandoned her. The effect of his hyber-aura wore off and Lelith became Luornu again. But when she left Ikros and merged back into one body, Luornu found that Lelith's mind was still present and sealed off from her own mind, and she had to fight to expel the evil from her second body.

When she assimilated back together, she gained the knowledge that each body had experienced while separated. Though her three bodies were shown to bicker on occasion, they were generally portrayed as being completely harmonious with each other.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Duo Damsel<\/b> (Original Continuity): After one of her bodies was murdered by Computo, Luornu could only split into two identical bodies. To reflect this loss, she changed her name to Duo Damsel and her costume's orange\/purple color scheme became split down the middle. Her ability to survive and fully operate despite the loss of her third body was considered unique among her race and she retained full membership in the Legion.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Una<\/b> (Original Continuity): Near the end of original Legion continuity, Luornu's second body was destroyed in a battle with one the Legion's greatest enemies, the Time Trapper. Though once again she defied the odds and survived the loss of yet another body, with only one body remaining she was essentially powerless. She changed her code name to Una and resigned from active duty.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Triad<\/b> (Earth-247): Unlike other incarnations, the reboot (Earth-247) Triad's bodies manifested three separate and distinct personalities who shared a mental and physical link, which was considered highly unusual among Carggites. One personality was her \"normal\" self, the second was aggressive and extroverted, and the third was shy and introverted. Because of her separate personalities she preferred to remain in triplicated form. At one point each body also manifested very different physical characteristics to reflect their different personalities (though they still had the same facial features): The aggressive one became unusually tall and strong, the shy one became much smaller and faster, and the \"normal\" personality remained the same size.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Triplicate Girl<\/b> (Earth-Prime): The \"threeboot\" Luornu was different from other incarnations, in that while on her home planet of Cargg she could apparently create an unlimited number of duplicates. However, she could not duplicate once off the planet. Eventually three of her bodies decided to combine into one body and leave the planet, since in this manner she could still split into three separate bodies while away from Cargg. The result was that this Luornu essentially had the same powers as the Triplicate Girl of original continuity, despite a notably different origin. However, the vast number of Luornu duplicates still remaining on Cargg rejected assimilation with the Triplicate Girl Luornus when they tried to return home, leaving Triplicate Girl on her own and completely isolated from her native Carggite bodies.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Duplicate Girl\/Damsel<\/b> (Retroboot): Luornu finally received a major power upgrade in current Legion continuity. She now has the power to split herself into an apparently endless number of identical bodies no matter where she is. It is not yet known if there is any upper limit to her duplication ability. To reflect her newfound power she changed her code name to Duplicate Damsel and then to Duplicate Girl, though she has gone back to wearing a variation of her classic 1970's Duo Damsel costume.<\/p><h3>Unarmed Combat<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In all of her forms, Luornu has mastered a specialized Carggite form of martial arts called Trijitsu, which was developed by her people to take full advantage of three forms fighting simultaneously.

When Saturn Girl learned that a Legionnaire was fated to die on a mission, she used her mental powers to influence the team to elect her as team leader. In so doing, she had the authority to bench the rest of the team and sacrifice her own life to spare those of her teammates. But <a href=\"..\/..\/lightning-lad\/29-1253\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightning Lad<\/a>, who had feelings for Saturn Girl that were secretly reciprocated, defied her orders and sacrificed his own life to save her. Grief-stricken by Lightning Lad's death, Saturn Girl then tried sacrifice her own life again in order to bring him back to life, but this time her telepathic friend <a href=\"..\/..\/proty\/29-12861\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Proty<\/a> took her place. Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad then declared their love for each other. Despite learning that Saturn Girl had rigged the election, her teammates continued to support her as leader of the Legion. She had a celebrated first year as Legion leader and even won a challenge the next year to legitimately earn a second term -- a first in Legion history. Saturn Girl served stalwartly on the Legion, dedicating her life to the team even after her stint as leader ended. She and Lightning Lad dated for several years, even staging a fake marriage for a Legion mission before he proposed actual marriage.<\/p><p style=\"\">Saturn Girl spent most of original continuity in her trademark 'red skirt' costume, featuring a white front with a yellow Saturn logo on her chest. Like many Legionnaires she underwent a sexy makeover during the 1970's, wearing a daring pink bikini-like outfit with long pink boots and gloves and the Saturn logo on her navel where the bikini top and bottom joined. In the 1980's she switched back to her more modest red skirt costume, which lasted until the end of original continuity.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1494\/85206-164509-saturn-girl.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-85206\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1494\/85206-164509-saturn-girl.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-85206\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1494\/85206-164509-saturn-girl.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1494\/85206-164509-saturn-girl.png\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Saturn Girl (Earth-247)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">As a child, Imra Ardeen displayed top-level telepathic abilities and was taken from her family at the age of five to begin years of intense mental training with the best minds of Titan. Her younger sister, Jancel, would resent Imra for this and viewed it as special treatment despite the fact Imra initially hated it. Imra became very disciplined and excelled at all she did, earning the rank of a tenth level telepath and being so strong that her mentor, Aven, installed mental blocks to dampen Imra's power. She was fast-tracked to become a Science Police officer and was assigned to Earth despite the stigma against telepaths there. En route, she and two bystanders saved the life of R.J. Brande. Brande wanted Imra and the boys to help him form a new symbol for unity: the Legion of Super-Heroes.<\/p><p style=\"\">In Earth-247 reality, Saturn Girl wore a pantsuit rather than a skirt, and pink replaced red in her uniform.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29837\/794642-saturngirl_cv49.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-794642\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.9664948453608\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:196.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29837\/794642-saturngirl_cv49.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-794642\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/29837\/794642-saturngirl_cv49.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/29837\/794642-saturngirl_cv49.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Saturn Girl (Earth-Prime)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In the 31st century of Earth Prime, Titanians only communicated telepathically and have lost their vocal cords to evolution.

Her mother was now a councilwoman in the <a href=\"..\/..\/united-planets\/65-56731\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Planets<\/a> and one of the few Legion supporters. When the Legion was dealing with the phantom <a href=\"..\/..\/mon-el\/29-21508\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mon-El<\/a>, Imra was able to hear his cries for help via telepathy, making her instrumental in locating him.

Jim manufactured another gravity regulator helmet for her, which enabled her to become his partner Bulletgirl.

She began her crime-fighting as the masked Blue Bulleteer using a pair of revolvers as her main weapon. In the 1960's she became the pupil of the wizard <a href=\"\/azagoth\/4005-31039\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31039\">Azagoth<\/a>. He took her to another dimension called <a href=\"\/limbo\/4020-42990\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42990\">Limbo<\/a> for her magic training. She later reappeared on earth as Nightveil, with her youth regained and ready to fight crime again.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p style=\"\">The story of Nightveil's creation is a complicated one. In the early 1970's, <a href=\"\/ac\/4010-335\" data-ref-id=\"4010-335\">AC<\/a> Comics began using the <a href=\"\/golden-age-of-comics\/4015-55820\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55820\">Golden Age<\/a> character of <a href=\"\/phantom-lady\/4005-32175\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32175\">Phantom Lady<\/a> (aka Sandra Knight) in their titles, believing that the character was now in the <a href=\"\/public-domain-characters\/4015-55750\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55750\">Public Domain<\/a>. They starting out by reprinting her Fox Feature era issues from the 1950's, and eventually began featuring Phantom Lady in their own original stories. However, <a href=\"\/dc-comics\/4010-10\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC<\/a> Comics had claimed ownership of the Phantom Lady, stating they had purchased the copyrights of Golden Age <a href=\"\/quality-comics\/4010-15\" data-ref-id=\"4010-15\">Quality Comics<\/a> characters, including Phantom Lady, <a href=\"\/human-bomb\/4005-4926\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4926\">Human Bomb<\/a>, <a href=\"\/doll-man\/4005-23313\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23313\">Doll Man<\/a> and others.<\/p><p style=\"\">Not wanting to engage in a lawsuit with the larger publisher, AC rewrote their version of the Phantom Lady, changing her name to the <b>Blue Bulleteer<\/b> and giving her pistols as weapons. They further decided to modernize her character by placing her in the extra-dimensional plane of Limbo with a magical mentor named Azagoth, while decades passed in our world. Laura emerged from Limbo in modern times with new powers and a new identity, calling herself Nightveil, and has since adapted to the current time period.<\/p><p style=\"\">As it turns out, the copyright to <b>some<\/b> of Phantom Lady's earlier appearances are now in the Public Domain, while DC continues to maintain that the original Golden Age version published by Quality Comics is owned by their company (this version can be easily distinguished from the Public Domain version since she wears a yellow and green costume, rather than red and blue). <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Powers and Paraphernalia<\/h2><p style=\"\">Nightveil wields formidable magical powers including teleportation, levitation, and retrocognition, to name a few. Her powers are connected to her <a href=\"\/cloak-of-darkness\/4055-56510\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56510\">Cloak of Darkness<\/a>, an inherently evil magical artifact. While this makes her arguably among the most powerful beings on earth, Laura must constantly struggle to keep the evil influence of her Cloak in check. She is at times insecure in her own ability to do so and is disturbed by the possibility that the Cloak may already be corrupting her in some way. Because of this, she has developed a brooding personality and her <a href=\"\/femforce\/4060-27873\" data-ref-id=\"4060-27873\">FemForce<\/a> teammates often have difficulty relating to her. She spends much of her time in solitude in her private sanctum, located somewhere in the <a href=\"\/everglades\/4020-56632\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56632\">Everglades<\/a>.

However since Nancy had walked into the spell blast and received its magical properties instead, she had now become the new Dragonfly. Ken next runs tests on her new body's properties discovering she obtained super-strength, near invulnerability due to a telekinetic ability, and can fly at amazing speeds. Nancy next goes to visit her sister and letting her in on her new transformation, discussing Ken's treatments and experiments.

Dragonfly realizes she can use her telekinesis to hold the skyscraper up until she can rescue all the workers, but the helicopter pilot sees her and shoots her in the back with a barrage of machine-gun fire. Hit and hurt by the bullets and unable to keep aloft or continue lifting the building telekinetically due to her wounds, she falls and lets go of her mental hold on the falling structure and the workers. When Skyjack lands his helicopter and dismounts to finish the job and shoot Dragonfly her telekinetic abilities kick in again, coating her in a protective field and the bullets bounce harmlessly off.

The art in the Fawcett run is superior art, especially in the early issues. The stories are excellent with much action and many thrills. While the Fawcett issues hail from the Golden Age of Comics and are prior to the Comics Code Authority censorship which began in the mid-1950's, there really are not that many bondage covers here. While there is a fair amount of bondage within the stories and Nyoka faces death door multiple times in many issues, this lovely girl is not the traditional Golden Age helpless female. Nyoka shows an unreal amount of resourcefulness and finds ways to get herself out of some of the worst jams one can imagine.<\/p><p style=\"\">Apparently the Nyoka comicbook was popular, as Republic Pictures made two separate cliffhanger serials based upon the jungle heroine. The first one, Jungle Girl, was produced in 1941 and stars Frances Gifford as Nyoka. It is an excellent serial in it's own right, well above average by the way, but it cannot begin compare to the sequel. The 1942 Republic cliffhanger serial called The Perils of Nyoka is a masterpiece! This writer has over 100 cliffhanger serials in his personal collection and considers The Perils of Nyoka, aka Nyoka and the Tigermen, to be the best serial ever released! Lovely Kay Aldridge stars as Nyoka, with Lorna Gray taking the part of her rival and nemesis, Vultura. Clayton Moore of The Longer Ranger fame gets to act of Nyoka's main assistant and Charles Middleton from the Flash Gordon serials gets the part of Vultura's main ally. Not only are the actors and actresses cast perfectly here, but the chapter cliffhanger endings are quite frankly \"as good as it gets\". While many serials have a few cliffhanger endings that are exceptional, this 15-part serial is lucky enough to have every single cliffhanger as well above average and the vast majority of them are exceptional! Truth be told, there are so many first-rate cliffhanger endings in this serial, that it is almost an impossible task to choose which one is the best of all. As if anything else is needed to make this serial a classic, it is loaded with catfights! There are at least four separate fights between Nyoka and Vultura in this serial. One of the differences between the two Nyoka serials is that the 1941 version looks more like sub-Saharan Africa and the 1942 version reminds one more of North Africa locations. There also is a difference in the quality of the prints. While the 1941 serial is in relatively nice shape, the 1942 version looks even better.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\">The 1941 cliffhanger serial gave Nyoka the name of Nyoka Meredith.  However, the 1942 film changed her name to Nyoka Gordon. The Fawcett comic decided to go with the Gordon name, as it refers to her father as Dr. Gordon.<\/p><p style=\"\">

Her powers stem from a pair of special boxing gloves that grant her superhuman strength and durability.","description":"<h2>History<\/h2><p style=\"\">During the Great Depression the super-villain who called himself \u201cThe Boxer\u201d attempted to rob an bank in Atlanta order to make ends meet. The robbery was going exactly as he planned until the hero, Thor Man, entered the scene. The two men battled briefly, until one of the Boxer\u2019s gloves came loose. Even as the boxing glove fell from his hand, Thor Man struck a decisive blow directly into the middle of the Boxer\u2019s chest.<\/p><p style=\"\">What Thor Man didn\u2019t realize, was that the Boxer\u2019s gloves were the source of his invulnerability and with them gone he was nothing more than a simple man. As a result, Thor Man\u2019s strike crushed the Boxer\u2019s chest; killing him instantly. Horrified and distracted by the carnage his hammer just wrought, Thor Man didn\u2019t notice when the security guard who had been guarding the bank at the time, surreptitiously stole the gloves and slipped away with them.<\/p><p style=\"\">The security guard initially hoped to sell the gloves in order to make ends meet but eventually found that he risk them falling into the wrong hands. He even wore them himself for a time, taking on the name of the Boxer himself and fighting crime when necessary.<\/p><p style=\"\">Decades later, the guard\u2019s grand-daughter found the gloves secreted away in his home and asked about their history. Then an old man, the guard told her of the gloves checkered past and when she asked for them, he happily passed them on to her.<\/p><p style=\"\">Contrary to popular belief following her first appearance on to the superhero scene, Knockout is actually flat-chested, but during the time she was employed by Capes Inc, she wore a pair of prosthetic breast enhancements as part of her superhero costume because, in her words, \"the world just doesn't want flat-chested superheroines\". Apparently this held true for her employers, as her salary did indeed double after she started wearing them.<\/p><p style=\"\">When the Guardians of the Globe held a membership drive after Invincible left Earth to fight in the Viltrumite War, Knockout and her teammate\/boyfriend Kid Thor were selected to become Canada's representatives on the Guardians of the Globe. She has been part of the fights against The Walking Dread and the new War Woman, both of The Order. After joining the Guardians, she stopped wearing her prosthetics altogether, and apparently hold no shame at being flat-chested, possibly because people actually like a superheroine that breaks the mold and shows the world that you don't need to look like someone else's idea of beauty to be a superhero.<\/p><p style=\"\">Recently, she found herself on the receiving end of Outrun's romantic advances, something that visibly unnerved her. She hadn't expected the speedster to be so forward, and rebuffed her, which in turn caused Outrun to call her both \"uptight\" and \"old-fashioned.\" Knockout responded in annoyance by referring to herself as a \"one-partner-at-a-time type,\" but had her thought cut short by Ms. Popper, who had teleported in to the Guardian's HQ to ask for their assistance in a situation that Best Tiger, Kaboomerang, Japandroid, and Samson were dealing with in Kuwait. Both heroines were more than happy to agree and joined the fray, ready to blow off some steam by busting heads.<\/p><p style=\"\">Despite the constant risks, Kid Thor and Knockout seemed to thrive among their teammates and come out of their insane battles relatively unscathed. That is, until Kid Thor faced the mad god Thoth in India.<\/p><p style=\"\">Thoth murdered Kid with casual ease during their battle. When his remains were returned to the Guardians\u2019 headquarters in Utah, Knockout wept over his corpse until she inadvertently resurrected him when she placed his magical hammer onto his chest.<\/p><p style=\"\">Kid\u2019s miraculous resurrection, and the insane events of their lives, caused Knockout to re-evaluate their relationship status. She now wants to marry Kid as soon as possible, in order to never be apart from her lover.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p style=\"\">Knockout is a capable pugilist; presumably she has received some form of formal training in American Style Boxing.<\/p><h2>Weapons and Equipment<\/h2><p style=\"\">Knockout employs a unique pair of boxing gloves in combat. Through some unknown method be it technological or magical, the gloves grant their wearer the ability to strike physical objects with superhuman force in addition to a measure of invulnerability.

Her royal heritage can be traced back since the dawn of humanity and her family's kingdom lies hidden in the Great Rift Valley of Africa, the valley that spawned the human race itself. The power in her family is transferred from mother to daughter. Her mother, Princess <a href=\"\/ndare-munroe\/4005-42526\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42526\">N'Dare<\/a>, rebelled against their tradition as she felt that she was forced to do the role that was given to her. She then married an American photojournalist, <a href=\"\/david-munroe\/4005-21956\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21956\">David Munroe<\/a>, and they lived in Manhattan. They moved to Cairo, Egypt when Ororo was still an infant. When Ororo was five, she and her family were caught in an Arab-Israeli conflict. Her parents were killed and Ororo ended up buried under rubble next to her mother's body. Because of this, Ororo has a life long struggle to overcome her severe claustrophobia. Ororo was never sought after by her own people in fear of her safety as her own uncle, Shetani, who felt left out and wanted to rule, threatened that he would kill Ororo should her people even <a href=\"#\" rel=\"nofollow\">try<\/a> to find her. Storm, by birth, is the rightful heir to her family's kingdom and to the oldest royal family on the face of the Earth.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p style=\"\">Storm was created by the writer <a href=\"..\/..\/len-wein\/26-41457\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Len Wein<\/a> and artist <a href=\"..\/..\/dave-cockrum\/26-4447\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dave Cockrum<\/a> and made her first ever appearance in <i>Giant Size X-Men<\/i> # 1 in May 1975. Storm was created using different characters that were originally intended to be used in the <a href=\"..\/..\/legion-of-super-heroes\/65-19241\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Of Superheroes<\/a> comic book. During an interview in 1999, Len Wein explained that the original black female character of Legion would have been named The Black Cat and wore a similar costume to Storm but without the cape and sported cat-like haircut and ears. However, due to other female cat-like characters like <a href=\"..\/..\/tigra\/29-21188\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tigra <\/a>appearing, Dave Cockrum decided to re-design the new character and give her white hair and a black cape and the name Storm.<\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85507\/2505396-lookn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2505396\" data-ratio=\"0.74346405228758\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85507\/2505396-lookn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2505396\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/85507\/2505396-lookn.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Goddess of the Plains<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Since her introduction, Storm has always played a very prominent role in the world of the X-Men. In her early days after her first appearance she was a major character in the new team of X-Men following the relaunch of the mutant team in 1975. Then perhaps her definitive role was as leader of the X-Men after <a href=\"..\/..\/professor-x\/29-1505\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X<\/a> went into space with the <a href=\"..\/..\/starjammers\/65-14871\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starjammers<\/a> for a time. She led the team through many huge challenges: the Mutant Massacre and Inferno to name but two, even through a long period when she had lost her powers. Following the return of Professor X, the X-Men were split into two teams, Gold (led by Storm) and Blue (led by <a href=\"..\/..\/cyclops\/29-1459\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops<\/a>). During that period her closest male relationship was with <a href=\"..\/..\/forge\/29-4279\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forge<\/a>, however due to Storm being busy with the X-Men all the time, Forge felt left out and knew that her heart would always be with the X-Men and not with him which ended with the two breaking up. Following the discovery of <a href=\"..\/..\/destinys-diaries\/18-44250\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Destiny's diaries<\/a>, Storm led the X-Treme X-Men and then the X.S.E. teams. Most recently Storm has married <a href=\"..\/..\/black-panther\/29-1477\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Panther<\/a> and taken on a new leadership role in <a href=\"..\/..\/wakanda\/34-41027\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wakanda<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Following the events of Doom War, both Storm and T'challa have left Wakanda for more heroic duties, Storm is now a main-stay member of the X-Men yet again and is was in charge of the Utopia Security Team.<\/p><p style=\"\">After the events of Schism she stayed with Cyclops' team but following the events of Avengers vs X-Men she left his team to join Wolverine's achool and his team. Currently she has formed a new X-Men team with Monet, Rachel Summers, Psylocke and Jubillee. Whether she stays as the leader or not is yet to be seen.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Orphan in Cairo<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4762\/1215756-storm_marker_sketch_in_color_by_portela.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1215756\" data-ratio=\"1.375\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4762\/1215756-storm_marker_sketch_in_color_by_portela.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1215756\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4762\/1215756-storm_marker_sketch_in_color_by_portela.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4762\/1215756-storm_marker_sketch_in_color_by_portela.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Storm<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">As an orphan in Cairo, Ororo was forced to live on the streets. She was taken in by <a href=\"..\/..\/achmed-el-gibar\/29-26034\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Achmed El-Gibar<\/a> who taught her the many skills of thievery and hand to hand combat. While in Cairo, Storm has her first encounter with <a href=\"..\/..\/professor-x\/1505\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charles Xavier<\/a>, a powerful telepath who would go on form the team of mutants called the <a href=\"..\/..\/x-men\/3173\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men<\/a>. Through Ororo's attempt to pick Xavier's pocket, Charles meets the <a href=\"..\/..\/shadow-king\/29-14889\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow King<\/a>. Storm also proves her skills as a thief by stealing a rare ruby-colored gem, the so-called \"heart of eternal darkness\" against Achmed's orders. Years later, it would be discovered that this stone contained the essence of the immortal mutant <a href=\"..\/..\/candra\/29-7900\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Candra<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Years later, Ororo leaves <a href=\"..\/..\/egypt\/34-55877\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Egypt<\/a> and returns to her ancestral homeland of <a href=\"..\/..\/kenya\/34-55951\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kenya<\/a>. On the way there, Ororo accepts a ride with a man who attempts to rape her. Ororo killed the man with a knife, but swears never to take a life again. After nearly dying of thirst in the Sahara desert, Ororo learns that she has the power to control the weather. She also learns that <a href=\"..\/..\/republic-of-south-africa\/34-55912\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">South Africa<\/a>ns, under the leadership of <a href=\"..\/..\/andreas-de-ruyter\/29-63537\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andreas de Ruyter,<\/a> were trying to kidnap Prince <a href=\"..\/..\/black-panther\/29-1477\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">T'Challa of Wakanda<\/a>, who was a little older than her. Storm uses her powers to help him escape, and the two travel together for a while, growing attracted to each other, but Ororo's dream and T'Challa's duty meant they couldn't be together yet.<\/p><p style=\"\">Making her home in the Serengeti Plain in Kenya, Storm calls out to her goddess and is answered with the sight of a shining figure of a woman, who resembles her. Adopted as a goddess of life by the local tribes, Storm helps however she can, with her powers. The connection between the weather and her emotional state lead her to detach herself from stronger emotions as far as possible to protect the people. An elderly tribal woman, Ainet, helps her learn how to responsibly use her complex powers. When a threat arises from a fellow mutant called <a href=\"..\/..\/deluge\/29-58090\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deluge<\/a>, who had wrested control over the weather from her in an attempt to revenge himself on humanity. Ororo managed to destroy Deluge and disperse the storm with the help of the X-Men, stranded in Kenya at that time. The X-Men inform Professor X about this promising mutant, however, he already knows of her, but hadn\u2019t contacted her before because he thought the cultural shock would be too much for her to handle.<\/p><h3>Joining the X-Men<\/h3><p style=\"\">Eventually however, Xavier is left with no choice but to contact Ororo and ask her assistance in rescuing the X-Men, explaining to her that she was not a goddess but a mutant. Ororo agrees to join the X-Men and returns to live in America. The new X-Men's first mission tasks them with rescuing the original X-Men from the living island of <a href=\"..\/..\/krakoa\/29-26409\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Krakoa<\/a>. Acclimatizing to life in America, Ororo was naive in the ways of the modern world; for example, she had no idea why there was any need for clothing, if one didn't feel cold.<\/p><p style=\"\">Storm quickly makes friends among the X-Men, regarding them as a family, with an especially strong bond of friendship with <a href=\"..\/..\/jean-grey\/29-3552\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jean Grey<\/a>, who helped Ororo to buy a new wardrobe. It was during one of their shopping tours that Jean learned of Storm\u2019s severe claustrophobia when the two women were chasing a thief into a subway station.<\/p><h3>Deadly Genesis<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5648\/292439-155811-x-men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-292439\" data-ratio=\"1.235\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5648\/292439-155811-x-men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-292439\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5648\/292439-155811-x-men.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5648\/292439-155811-x-men.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>X-Men<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">When the X-Men are taken into <a href=\"..\/..\/space\/34-56254\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">space<\/a> by the Sentinels and held as prisoners in Lang's sentinel factory above Earth, during their escape they are forced to use a damaged space craft to reenter the Earth's atmosphere. With Jean as the only person on board who would survive long enough to pilot the ship, everyone else remains protected in the radiation room. Jean is replaced by the <a href=\"..\/..\/dark-phoenix\/29-9731\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phoenix<\/a> during the reentry. To get away from all the stress the team decides to take a vacation to <a href=\"..\/..\/banshee\/29-9708\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee's<\/a> home Cassidy Keep.

However, Storm blames herself for the accidental death of Garokk, which leaves her traumatized. Storm then distances herself from the other X-Men and wandered around the Savage Land on her own where she saves a mysterious woman, M'rin, from a savage beast. Finding herself in another fantastic dimension adjacent to the Savage Land, M\u2019rin - who is this dimension\u2019s warrior queen - befriends Ororo and regards her as her surrogate daughter. Before Storm leaves, M\u2019rin showed her how to use her mother\u2019s ruby crystal to open the dimensional gates and come visit her, if she wishes.<\/p><h3>Asgardian Wars<\/h3><p style=\"\">As the X-Men leave the Savage Land aboard a raft, they are caught in a massive gale that brings them to Japan where Storm and the team help battle <a href=\"..\/..\/moses-magnum\/29-11915\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moses Magnum<\/a>.

While successful, the effort required leaves her physically exhausted. Back in New York, Storm decides to visit the apartment in Harlem, where her parents fell in love and where she was born.<\/p><p style=\"\">Arriving at the building where her family used to live, she is shocked to find out that it was now occupied by some drug addicted kids.

This causes Ororo to start to doubt her life as an X-Man. Some time later, Storm is kidnapped by <a href=\"..\/..\/arkon\/29-19947\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arkon the Imperion<\/a>, emperor of the other-dimensional world Polemachus, who wanted someone with control over lightning to restore the machine that kept the energy-rings around their world. Ororo is actually willing to help, even though it would have cost her life. With the aid of the other X-Men, any loss of life was avoided. This adventure reminded her that life as an X-Man was more than just one battle after the next.<\/p><p style=\"\">When a new student, the teenager <a href=\"..\/..\/kitty-pryde\/29-3548\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kitty Pryde<\/a>, joins the X-Men, Ororo develops motherly feelings towards the girl, whose parents\u2019 marriage was disintegrating. Around the same time as this, Storm is captured and humiliated by the telepathic <a href=\"..\/..\/emma-frost\/29-1457\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White Queen<\/a> (Emma Frost) who telepathically probes Ororo for information on the X-Men.

Doom and Ororo feel some attraction towards each other; however, Doom still traps her and her fellow mutants and transforms Storm into a statue of organic chrome.<\/p><p style=\"\">For a claustrophobic, this was a nightmare come true. Subconsciously, she started to warp weather patterns all over the world, creating a giant thunderstorm. When her teammates finally free her, she is immensely more powerful and close to insanity in her rage. The other X-Men make her realize she is heading down the same path as the Phoenix, and she reins in her power and stops the storm and spares Doom's life. When Storm brings Kitty to the White Queen's Massachusetts Academy on Kitty\u2019s parents' wishes, the White Queen uses a device to switch bodies with Storm. After freeing herself, it still takes Storm some time to convince Kitty that it was really her stuck inside Emma Frost\u2019s body. With their personalities restored again, Storm almost kills Emma in the final battle, but Wolverine, holds her back and reminds her that she is better than that. Storm is then ambushed by an assassin hired by the Bull. Teaming up with the Black Panther, her first love, they locate the Bull, and defeat the Bull's robot. This also kills The Bull himself as he was psychically connected to the robot.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/37573\/1459714-storm16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1459714\" data-ratio=\"0.62947368421053\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/37573\/1459714-storm16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1459714\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/37573\/1459714-storm16.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/37573\/1459714-storm16.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Storm and Arkon<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Later, Ororo and the team join the <a href=\"..\/..\/fantastic-four\/65-3804\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantastic Four<\/a> to return to Polemachus, the world ruled by Arkon. <a href=\"..\/..\/badoon\/65-22907\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Badoon<\/a> had invaded and taken control of Polemachus, and had taken <a href=\"..\/..\/mr-fantastic\/29-2151\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reed<\/a> and Arkon prisoner.

Storm battles the twins to protect a local woman, but is grazed on the temple by a bullet and is knocked out. Awakening, she travels across a desolate plain of Africa, encountering a woman who was going into labor who she helps give birth at her village. Storm comes to terms with the loss of her powers and goes to Cairo where she helps the <a href=\"..\/..\/new-mutants\/65-15971\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Mutants<\/a> defeat the Shadow King.<\/p><p style=\"\">Storm and the New Mutants are all then transported to <a href=\"..\/..\/asgard-marvel\/34-40990\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asgard<\/a> by <a href=\"..\/..\/loki\/29-4324\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loki<\/a>, in a scheme of his to take over Asgard. The X-Men travel to Asgard to rescue them all. Loki tempts Storm with the title of the Goddess of Thunder and gives her Freya's cloak of magic feathers and a mystically enhanced hammer. At first she attacks Wolverine, but he is able to help Storm see through Loki's deception, and she returns to Earth with her team. Upon her return, Storm learns that Magneto had been appointed headmaster of the school by Professor X. Cyclops had returned to the X-men while Storm was on Asgard and resumed leadership of the team, but Storm challenges Cyclops in a duel for leadership and defeats him.<\/p><h3>Mutant Massacre<\/h3><p style=\"\">Some time later, the mutant geneticist <a href=\"\/mr-sinister\/4005-3179\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\">Mister Sinister<\/a> sends his <a href=\"..\/..\/marauders\/65-40480\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marauders<\/a> to exterminate the Morlocks. The X-Men quickly venture into the underground tunnels to investigate. They save a few survivors, but several X-Men suffer horrific injuries when the team encounters the killers. Storm feels she had failed as a leader, but Callisto, slaps her back into taking up her responsibilities again.<\/p><h3>Fall of the Mutants<\/h3><p style=\"\">With more and more enemies to mutants in general rallying against them, <a href=\"..\/..\/hellfire-club\/65-13357\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Hellfire Club<\/a> proposes an alliance with the X-Men, offering Magneto the seat of White King. After discussing this with Ororo, he accepts, with his own condition that he and Storm would jointly assume the title of White King. However, Ororo would not be not available for much longer. The Marauder Malice's attempt to possess the body of Dazzler and the bombing of the house of Jean Grey\u2019s sister, Sara, indicates that somebody is trying to get to the X-Men by harming their friends and families. As these enemies would apparently only stop once the X-Men were dead, Storm decides to go underground; Naming Wolverine deputy leader, Storm travels to Dallas to ask for Forge\u2019s help. Finding his home derelict, she meets who she thinks is his old mentor <a href=\"..\/..\/naze\/29-15143\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Naz\u00e9<\/a>. Naz\u00e9 tells her that Forge (a powerful, but reluctant, Shaman) has probably been claimed by his nemesis, <a href=\"..\/..\/adversary\/29-26995\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Adversary<\/a> and will try to destroy the world in his name. Storm accompanies Naz\u00e9 (really a Dire Wraith who had previously disguised itself thus, now serving as host for the Adversary) on a dangerous quest to find Forge. Storm starts to admit to herself that she still loves Forge, but is convinced that he has gone evil, thanks to Naz\u00e9\u2019s subtle manipulations. She confronts Forge on a mountain, surrounded by demons, with a gate to another dimension above him, and stabs him, only then realizing that he had in fact been trying to close the gate and save Earth.<\/p><p style=\"\">In Dallas, time and space suddenly go crazy. Meanwhile Storm and the heavily injured Forge find themselves transported to another Earth, devoid of any human life. After spending a year there, they realize that the Adversary is giving them the chance to become parents to a new humanity on this world while destroying their own. The two decide that they have to try and save their own Earth. Forge uses the technology in his artificial leg to create an anti-Neutralizer, giving Storm back her powers and her lightning is used to energize a portal back to Earth. The magical spell to counter the one Forge cast many years ago, which had freed the Adversary, needs nine souls to give it energy. Thus, the X-Men and their companion <a href=\"..\/..\/madelyne-pryor\/29-10981\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madelyne Pryor<\/a>, on live TV, sacrifice themselves for Forge\u2019s spell. Secretly the X-Men are returned to life by <a href=\"..\/..\/roma\/29-14810\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roma<\/a>, and, following Storm\u2019s original plan they let everybody believe they are still dead, in order to better strike back at their enemies. The team relocates to the former hideout of the <a href=\"..\/..\/reavers\/65-9726\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reavers<\/a>, in the Australian Outback. Storm gets the chance to reacquaint herself with her foster mother, M\u2019rin, after freeing Garrok from the influence of <a href=\"\/terminus\/4005-14542\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14542\">Terminus<\/a> in the Savage Land.<\/p><h3>Inferno<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/37573\/1459954-storm37.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1459954\" data-ratio=\"1.1781818181818\" data-width=\"275\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 275px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:117.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/37573\/1459954-storm37.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1459954\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/37573\/1459954-storm37.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/37573\/1459954-storm37.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Lil' Storm &amp; Gambit<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">When Madelyne Pryor, with <a href=\"..\/..\/sym\/29-10291\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S'ym<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/nastirh\/29-42869\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">N'astirh<\/a> release a demon invasion of Earth, the X-Men meet X-Factor (the original 5 X-Men) for the first time. Some initial tension is soon overcome and Storm is happily reunited with her best friend. Storm destroys the demon N\u2019astirh by overloading his circuitry with her lightning. Cyclops is shocked that Storm just wanted to get the job done, by any means necessary. Back at their headquarters in the Australian Outback, the X-Men are attacked by the psychotic <a href=\"..\/..\/nanny\/29-7567\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nanny<\/a> and her underling, the <a href=\"..\/..\/orphan-maker\/29-25911\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orphan Maker<\/a> who capture Storm and fake her death with the help of a <a href=\"..\/..\/shield\/65-3775\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SHIELD<\/a> <a href=\"..\/..\/life-model-decoy\/18-42286\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">life model decoy<\/a>. The villains escape and once back in their base, Nanny physically and mentally reduces Storm to her pre-teens to better control her. However, Storm\u2019s claustrophobia gives her the strength to overload Nanny\u2019s systems and she escapes. The now approximately 11-12 year old Ororo finds herself in the city of Cairo, Illinois with no memories of her time with the X-Men or even why she was in America.<\/p><p style=\"\">Her powers hardly worked either, due to her youth. The Shadow King takes this opportunity to hunt her down. Taking over the body of FBI agent Jacob Reisz, he frames Ororo for murder. During a caper as a thief the Shadow King has his agents waiting for Ororo, but she is saved by a fellow mutant and thief named <a href=\"..\/..\/gambit\/29-1499\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gambit<\/a>. Gambit is intrigued and they form a partnership, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. Nanny finds them again, but they manage to beat her and destroy her aircraft, at the same time reactivating Storm\u2019s memories of what had happened to her and who she had been. Gambit and Storm are reunited with Banshee and Forge at the X-Mansion, as well with the New Mutants, <a href=\"..\/..\/cable\/29-2157\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cable<\/a> and X-Factor. Tests reveal that Ororo is stuck as a young girl, not able to grow or age and without full access to her powers.<\/p><h3>X-Tinction Agenda<\/h3><p style=\"\">The <a href=\"..\/..\/genosha\/34-40967\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genoshan<\/a> government, working together with old X-Factor enemy, <a href=\"..\/..\/cameron-hodge\/29-13379\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cameron Hodge<\/a>, plan to destroy the various X-Teams as revenge for an earlier defeat. They kidnap Storm and several New Mutants. In custody, Storm undergoes the conditioning process that the Genoshans had developed to turn mutants or mutates into obedient, mindless slaves. She is stripped of free will and is called Mutate 20. However, Genegineer <a href=\"..\/..\/genegineer-david-moreau\/29-28470\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moreau<\/a> and Chief Magistrate Anderson are among the faction working against Hodge and use Storm in a Trojan Horse gambit against him.

Several X-Men are captured by the residents when they try to stop the Shadow King. Professor Xavier, back on Earth, enlists the help of both X-Factor and SHIELD. After the villain was defeated, the original five X-Men rejoin. Storm is made leader of the so-called Gold Team. The arrival of the new X-Man, <a href=\"..\/..\/bishop\/29-1503\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bishop<\/a>, from the future, further strains the relationship between Storm and Forge, a relationship that was already on the rocks. Forge proposes to Storm, but Ororo hesitates. Jean Grey refuses to tell Forge about Storm\u2019s true feelings, and he becomes convinced that Storm didn\u2019t love him and could never be a complete person outside the X-Men.<\/p><p style=\"\">He retracts his proposal and leaves to help Mystique, although it turns out Storm would have said \u201cyes.\u201d After an incident in which <a href=\"..\/..\/mikhail-rasputin\/29-14830\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mikhail Rasputin<\/a>, Colossus' mad brother floods the Morlock tunnels, apparently killing them all, Forge invites Storm to dinner where they make up.

Children had grown up in the time since the X-Men saw them last and one group called the <a href=\"..\/..\/gene-nation\/65-15347\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gene Nation<\/a>, led by <a href=\"..\/..\/marrow\/29-13726\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marrow<\/a> \u2013 want revenge on the humans who had shunned the Morlocks. They plan another massacre on the anniversary of the Morlock Massacre. Storm confronts Marrow, and in single combat cuts out the girl\u2019s heart, before the bomb attached to it could explode. Unaware of the fact that Marrow had survived, as she actually had two hearts, Storm is deeply troubled by her choice, feeling that she was incapable of making working long-term decisions. While celebrating the Ceremony of Light as a remembrance ritual in the Morlock tunnels, she is teleported away by Mikhail Rasputin to his other dimension, where she was to become \u201cmother\u201d to the Morlocks. Storm learns that Rasputin actually backed Gene Nation. She forces him to return all the surviving Morlocks back to Earth and gives the Gene Nation members a choice. Either help rebuild the impoverished African village she had once visited \u2013 or else.<\/p><p style=\"\">Storm then presented a new look to her teammates. During that time Storm also called off her on-again-off again relationship with Forge for good, since she couldn\u2019t imagine a long-term future with him and started a subtle flirtation with Cable instead. Storm once more confronted Candra \u2013 who had by now learned that Storm had stolen her heart as a child \u2013 over the fate of the children Jamil and Karima. After facing several old foes and friends who couldn\u2019t possibly be there, Storm realized that Karima was a powerful mutant with the ability to make desires real and that Jamil was only an expression of her own desires. When Cyclops destroyed the ruby that contained Candra\u2019s essence, Storm\u2019s opponent perished and Ororo returned Karima home.<\/p><p style=\"\">After Cyclops and Phoenix leave the team to recuperate, Storm is once more leader of the X-Men, now including Marrow who tries to provoke her at every point and whose very presence reminds Storm of her own failures. Storm and Marrow make peace though, thanks in part to Marrow's burgeoning friendship with <a href=\"..\/..\/cannonball\/29-1496\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cannonball<\/a>. Following the restructuring of the X-Men, Storm takes a less active role and joins a division of the X-Men that travels around the world to face new threats in Venice, Italy, and Russia.<\/p><h3>X-Treme X-Men<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4\/55102-9411-76558-1-x-treme-x-men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-55102\" data-ratio=\"1.5025\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4\/55102-9411-76558-1-x-treme-x-men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-55102\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4\/55102-9411-76558-1-x-treme-x-men.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4\/55102-9411-76558-1-x-treme-x-men.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>X-Treme X-Men<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Shortly after her brief leave of absence, the X-Men learn of the <a href=\"..\/..\/destinys-diaries\/18-44250\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Diaries<\/a> of the late precog <a href=\"..\/..\/destiny\/29-3557\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Destiny<\/a>, which chronicled the future. With only one book in their possession, Ororo realizes that the diaries are too a dangerous weapon to be trusted to Charles Xavier following the incident with <a href=\"..\/..\/onslaught\/29-13352\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Onslaught<\/a>. Planning to find the rest of the diaries, Ororo asks Tessa AKA <a href=\"..\/..\/sage\/29-4559\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sage<\/a> to be among her group, as her analytical skills would be needed to make sense of the cryptic prophecies. However, the team is best with difficulties from the very beginning, not the least of which is the death of Storm's teammate <a href=\"..\/..\/psylocke\/29-3176\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Psylocke<\/a> at the hand of Vargas, who claims to be the true Homo Superior. Gambit asks Storm for the ruby she had inherited from her mother, which is part of a mysterious powerful group of gems called the Madripoor set. The ruby, as well as the other gems, is stolen by the other-dimensional warrior Shaitan, who also abducts Gambit. Shaitan uses the gems and Gambit\u2019s power to create a portal - a giant space needle in the making - to allow the other-dimensional armies of his master Khan, a conqueror of whole universes, to enter Madripoor. At the same time a force field prevents other heroes from entering Madripoor to help.<\/p><p style=\"\">After Storm saves Khan's life from Madripoor crime lord Viper, Khan becomes obsessed with Storm, recognizing in her a kindred spirit and an equal. When Viper strikes Ororo in the back, leaving her for dead, Khan takes her with him to another dimension, saved her life and was goingto make her his queen. Storm tried to convince him to stop his attempted conquest of Earth. Meanwhile, the other X-Men race against time to try and find Storm and to stop Khan\u2019s troops gaining access to Earth. Khan\u2019s concubines jealously try to murder Storm but she defeats them despite her injuries. Together, the X-Men manage to successfully stop the Invasion by sabotaging Khan\u2019s castle and blowing up the inter-dimensional portal, seemingly blowing Khan\u2019s ship up in the process. Ororo\u2019s serious injuries cause her to collapse, and have a near death experience but she wakes up again and has physical therapy for her back and legs. With their mission to find the diaries over (since Rogue now has access to them, thanks to her powers), the other X-Men ask Storm\u2019s team to return to the mansion. Storm, Sage and Bishop however, feel that someone has to defend the rights of humans and make sure that they <i>all<\/i> could co-exist peacefully. Storm and Gambit infiltrate a meeting of world leaders on mutant policy at the president's home. Storm makes Val Cooper, Alexi Vazjin and several other politicians an offer: she suggests a special police task force of mutants policing mutants given worldwide authority \u2013 the X.S.E. The idea is given a green light but, as a test, she is sent to Tokyo to apprehend the extra-dimensional slaver, Tullamore Voge. There she meets with her good friend Yukio. At a nightclub, Storm intervenes in a mutant vs. mutant fight in an underground arena and unwittingly became the new champion. Excited by the thrill and the rush, Ororo returns and fights Callisto. This battle turned out to be a trap; Callisto has new powers - tentacles in the place of her arms - and the fight was only a distraction for Storm to be defeated psychically, by operatives of Callisto\u2019s master, Masque.<\/p><p style=\"\">Storm and Callisto then outwardly live as champions, while remaining the slaves of Masque. However they defeat Masque before they can be sold as slaves to Tullamore Voge. Storm hands over control of the arenas to Callisto, to make them an organization offering safe harbor to mutants all over the world. Voge escapes, but his activities in Tokyo are brought to an end so the X.S.E. are given the go-ahead. After returning to her teammates, Ororo learns of the devastation of Manhattan at the hand of a madman claiming to be Magneto and the death of Jean Grey. Storm\u2019s team returned to Westchester to help rebuild the Xavier Institute, which now houses both the X-Men and the X.S.E.

The Fury defeats the combined forces of Bishop, Marvel Girl and Cannonball at Captain Britain's ancestral home, and then takes control of Sage through her cyber glasses. Storm is able to overcome this by absorbing lightning into herself. Storm, Wolverine and Nightcrawler find that Sage is too difficult a challenge to overcome, but Fury's control over Sage is weakened and she is able to free herself after being hit by an EMP from Storm.

The Bacchae - a team of women warriors - are defeated by Storm's team, thus freeing a man that was a friend of X-23.

Once they are defeated, Juggernaut takes down Spiral, and then Mojo is subsequently defeated by the X-Men.<\/p><h3>Wakanda and Marriage<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/1074378-116055_102818_storm_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1074378\" data-ratio=\"0.7625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/1074378-116055_102818_storm_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1074378\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6754\/1074378-116055_102818_storm_super.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6754\/1074378-116055_102818_storm_super.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Storm's marriage to the Black Panther<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">When the <a href=\"..\/..\/scarlet-witch\/29-1466\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scarlet Witch<\/a> goes crazy and creates an alternate world in which all mutants had their wishes fulfilled, after being brought back to reality she freaks out and depowers the majority of the world's mutants.

During his time in recovery, Storm takes political control of Wakanda, and nominates Shuri to go before the Panther God.

In limbo, T'Challa is successfully fighting off death and his forces, but it soon becomes too much, and he is about to be dragged off into the next life. Suddenly, a powerful wind sent all of his enemies flying away from him and Storm appears with lightning in both hands. In a bid to free T'Challa, Storm levels Death and his minions with a fierce wind attack, and reveals that the only way she could save T'Challa was to give her life in his place. Fortunately for the both of them, <a href=\"..\/..\/shuri\/29-58997\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shuri<\/a>, his sister and the new Black Panther, is able to lure and trap Morlun in their place, saving them both.<\/p><h3>Doom War and Loss of Husband<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/32897\/1253939-o___the_dm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1253939\" data-ratio=\"1.1527331189711\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/32897\/1253939-o___the_dm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1253939\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/32897\/1253939-o___the_dm.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/32897\/1253939-o___the_dm.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Storm Vs.

Storm meanwhile, used her powers to save the crops in the country but could not ascertain why they were still dying. In an unexpected confrontation with a mob, Storm blasted an angry farmer with lightning when he appeared to have drawn a weapon on her and was put on trial for crimes of treason, practicing witchcraft and crimes against humanity, and was imprisoned. Storm used her lockpicking skills as a former thief to pick the lock on her cell, but was captured by Doctor Doom, and forced to pick the lock to the vibranium vault under threat of the Queen mother and others being killed. Storm managed to pick all but the last of the locks before T'Challa finally reached Doom and Storm, who was released as Doom passed the final lock and met the Panther God.<\/p><p style=\"\">Doom passes the test by convincing the Panther God of his vision of humanity in his \"Doom World\". Storm, Black Panther (Shuri), the Dora Milaje and the Fantastic Four (Sue, Johnny and Ben) attack networks and vibranium storage facilities throughout the world. While on this mission, Storm and her team of Dora Milaje are surprise attacked by a massive vibranium-enhanced Kracken, but Storm successfully defeated it. Becoming one with the alien metal, Doom used his power to control any object or structure that contains vibranium to initiate attacks worldwide. Launching a final offensive, the team met Doom on the battlefield, and T'Challa used shadow physics to combine alchemy with quantum science in a way that would make vibranium useless, instantly defeating Doom. Storm destroys all the doombots in a massive multi-pronged lightning strike. Storm returns to Wakanda with her husband, storing the planet's remaining portions of the recovered pure vibranium.<\/p><p style=\"\">After T'Challa abdicated his throne at the conclusion of Doom War, he left his homeland and took Daredevil's place as the protector of Hell's Kitchen. Though Storm initally agreed to stay apart from her husband and promised to not interfere in T'Challa's mission of self discovery, Storm broke her promise and had Pixie teleport her to Hells Kitchen to save T'Challa from a fatal fall. Storm and T'Challa worked together to take down Kraven and save a boy, Brian, who was the reason T'Challa and Kraven had come into conflict.<\/p><h3>Astonishing X-Men<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/79196\/1467445-saving_abigail.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1467445\" data-ratio=\"0.82232704402516\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:82.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/79196\/1467445-saving_abigail.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1467445\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/79196\/1467445-saving_abigail.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/79196\/1467445-saving_abigail.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Saving Abigail<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Storm continued to be an active member of the X-Men, fighting along side both the Astonishing and Uncanny teams.

The Brood was using special S.W.O.R.D. technology that could safely and repeated remove the Brood progeny from a single host to repopulate their species. After repelling several attacks, and overcoming their own planned Brood infections, the team defeated the Brood, with Storm killing one of the queens with a lightning bolt, reversed their infections, and saved a new species of Brood that could peacefully co-exist with other life forms (later became Broo at the Jean Grey School For Gifted Youngsters).<\/p><h3>Second Coming<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85507\/1766726-tempest.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1766726\" data-ratio=\"0.59791122715405\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85507\/1766726-tempest.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1766726\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/85507\/1766726-tempest.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/85507\/1766726-tempest.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Fighting the Nimrods<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">When Storm, along with other members of the X-Men, is made aware of Cyclops' black ops team, <a href=\"..\/..\/x-force\/65-15595\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Force<\/a>, she is disgusted by the idea that he would put such a team together but, due to the situation at hand, she leaves it alone, promising to have a long talk with him after the current events are handled. It appears that <a href=\"..\/..\/bastion\/29-40568\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bastion<\/a>, has assembled some of the X-Men's most deadliest adversaries in an all out effort to destroy the mutant race.

At the conclusion, Storm approaches both Cyclops and <a href=\"..\/..\/wolverine\/29-1440\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine<\/a> about X-Force. She tells Wolverine that X-Men don't kill and that his actions make him no better than the enemy. Logan tells her that if he had the chance he'd do it all over again. She sits down to have a beer with him and tells him that this could be the last drink they will ever share.<\/p><h3>Regenesis - X-Men<\/h3><p style=\"\">Cyclops appointed Storm as leader of the security team, which consisted of Psylocke, Warpath, Jubilee, Domino and Colossus. The team was dispatched to retrieve Domino, whom they had lost contact with when she was attacked during a mission in Kupernicstan involving a sentinel smuggling ring. As they approached their destination, the team was confronted and told to leave the area by War Machine. Feining compliance Storm and her team proceeded to Kupernicstan anyway but was confronted a second time by a then agitated War Machine. After coming to an understanding, War Machine helped Storm's team battle the sentinels, which were launched in a large army to destroy Kupernicstan's neighboring country Symkaria, long enough for the rest of the team to defeat the rogue military group and deactivate the sentinels.<\/p><p style=\"\">At the end of their battle in Kupernicstan, Storm discovered Jubilee was missing, and set out with her team to find her. After weeks of searching, Jubilee was found to be on a remote island in China wtih a group of vampires called The Forgiven. Storm ordered her team to take down the vampires, with Storm battling Nighteyes, but Jubilee ended the conflict before it further escalated. As the two teams talked they discovered that the island was swarmed by various groups of assassins for hire, who had come to kill Raizo Kodo, leader of The Forgiven. Combining their efforts, the team defeated the assassins, with Jubilee choosing to stay with The Forgiven for the foreseeable future.<\/p><p style=\"\">Learning of mysterious sightings of monsters across the globe Storm's security team, which consists of Psylocke, Domino, Pixie and Colossus began to investigate. After they secured a sample and used resources outside of the X-Men to analyze their findings, Storm discovered that these monsters were actually \"proto-mutants\", a genetic off-shoot of the mutant species that were slaughtered centuries before, and that an unknown enemy, David Michael Gray, was recreating them in his secret lab. Considering the magnitude of this discovery, Storm chose to keep her findings a secret from Cyclops, which brought her into conflict with some of her team members. The team managed to secure one of the proto-mutants and learned of Dr.Gray's location, but arrived too late to stop him from killing himself and all of the proto-mutants. Storm finally reported the team's failure to Cyclops, and after a heated conversation, Storm and the team went in pursuit of their sample and recovered it, which had been stolen and placed into the hands of the Heavenly Path. They then encountered one of the original proto-mutants, Gabriel Shepard, who abruptly left the team after discovering what Dr.Gray did to his race. The internal tension between the team members, as a result of the conflict between Storm and Cyclops, continued to escalate, leading to an altercation between Storm and Colossus, and leaving the remaining team members disillusioned and unsure of the team's future.<\/p><h3>Regenesis - Uncanny X-Men<\/h3><p style=\"\">After the events of Schism split the X-Men into two separate factions, Storm, who explained to Cyclops that she was not fully in agreement with the direction he was taking the X-Men, was preparing to leave Utopia and join Wolverine's team of X-Men when Scott pleaded with her to stay. The team consisted of Magneto, Magik, Colossunaut, Namor, Danger and Emma Frost, he explained that he needed her to remain on Utopia to help him maintain control of what could be a potential disaster. Convinced by his compelling explanation, Storm agreed to remain on Utopia, and to be his second in command in the field. Cyclops met with Storm, Namor, Magneto, Colossus, Emma Frost, Hope, Danger and Magik and informs them that they will be the new Extinction team, the premiere and most powerful superhero team in the world. The team has taken on Sinister, the Phalanx and battled the \"Bad Apex\" in Tabula Rasa, where Storm ended the conflict by making the Apex see the error of his ways. At the conclusion of Avengers vs X-Men the Extinction team disbanded. Storm joined Wolverine at the Jean Grey School and is now the school's Headmistress.<\/p><h3>Joining The Avengers<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4251183-4975458248-20449.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4251183\" data-ratio=\"1.5185601799775\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4251183-4975458248-20449.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4251183\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4251183-4975458248-20449.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4251183-4975458248-20449.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Storm as an Avenger<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Looking to replenish the ranks of the Avengers, Captain America approached the Black Panther, who declined Steve\u2019s offer to return to the team, but recommended Storm for membership.

Believing that the Phoenix Force could reboot the mutant species, Cyclop's has the X-Men fight the Avengers to keep Hope with them, putting Storm in a difficult position of having to choose sides. Though she sided with the X-Men at the start of the conflict, Storm found her husband, and asked that he help her find a way to end the conflict, but T'Challa refused, and Storm replied that his pigheaded stubbornness is the reason the couple were in marriage counseling. As the conflict escalated, a small team of X-Men traveled to Wakanda in an effort to locate Hope, and encountered a team of Avengers, which included the Black Panther. Both he and Storm engaged each other in combat. At the climax of their fight, after being angered by T'Challa actually having a contingency plan in place to combat his own wife, Storm told T'Challa he was a terrible husband and threw her wedding ring to the ground. It is revealed in Avengers vs. X-Men # 9 that the Black Panther, after a Phoenix empowered Namor attacked and almost destroyed Wakanda , has annulled his marriage to Storm. Despite this, Storm, still assisted the Avengers with rescuing their captured teammates, who were imprisoned by the Phoenix imbued Colossus and Magik, and continued to fight on their side to help defeat the Phoenix Five.<\/p><h3>Uncanny X-Force Now<\/h3><p style=\"\">Storm is co-leading a new X-Force team with Psylocke. At Wolverine's request Storm and Psylocke aided Puck on a mission that brought them in contact with Spiral. After capturing Spiral, who was taking care of a young mutant girl Ginny, the team encounters a possessed Bishop. Bishop was after Ginny and captured her, but with Spiral's teleportation power they caught up with him and eventually defeated him. One of the revenant forces that possessed Bishop then possessed Ginny and disappeared. Storm and Psylocke went into Bishop's mind and saved him from the Demon Bear that was still inside him. Under the leadership of the Owl Queen, who had taken possession of Ginny, the team was then attacked and captured by an army of revenants, though with Storm's help Bishop managed to escape. The Owl Queen had the revenants of each of the team brought out of them, but once Bishop returned and freed them the team killed their own revenants. For the accomplishment of killing her own revenant Storm was christened by Bishop as a Holy Revenant Hunter of the Order. The Owl Queen turned out to be Cassandra Nova and she tried to lead an invasion of the earth by an army of revenants to destroy all of humanity, but she was defeated by the Uncanny X-Force.<\/p><p style=\"\">After a brief fight with Cable and his X-Force team over the discovery that Bishop had returned to the present Storm was briefly united with her former lover Forge.

At the conclusion of that battle Storm had to leave the team and returned to the school.<\/p><h3>All-Female X-Men Team<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/2813369-x_women.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2813369\" data-ratio=\"1.5182186234818\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/2813369-x_women.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2813369\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/2813369-x_women.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/2813369-x_women.png\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Storm leading the team<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Storm is also leading the first all-female X-Men team. The roster initially consists of Psylocke, Jubilee, Rachel Grey, Rogue, and Kitty Pryde. This team is a spiritual continuation of her former <a href=\"\/utopias-security-recon\/4060-59200\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59200\">Security Recon<\/a> Team, except now this team originates from the Jean Grey School instead of Utopia. The team took on Arkea, who is the sister to Sublime and has the ability to control technology and took control of Karima and attacked the school. During the mission Storm made the decision to kill Karima, who ultimately did not end up having to die, but brought Ororo into conflict with Rachel Grey, with Rachel questioning Storm's assumption of being the team's leader.<\/p><p style=\"\">A strain of the Arkea virus was retained and downloaded into Reiko, the assistant to Lady Deathstrike. Arkea recruited Enchantress, Typhoid Mary, and a revived Selene and Madelyne Pryor. They formed the Sisterhood. Storm's team found them, and after confronting Selene and Madelyne Storm made a deal to let them go in exchange for Arkea. Both ladies agreed and made their escape, allowing Storm's team to kill Arkea unabated. The team then encountered Shogo's father, The Future, who had kidnapped Jubilee and he tried to ransom her for the return of his son Shogo. Storm's team, aided by her daughter <a href=\"\/kymera\/4005-93013\" data-ref-id=\"4005-93013\">Kymera<\/a>, succeeded in defeating him.<\/p><h3>Exogenous<\/h3><p style=\"\">Director of S.W.O.R.D., <a href=\"\/abigail-brand\/4005-4441\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4441\">Abigail Brand <\/a>contacted the X-Men, asking them to visit the <a href=\"\/peak\/4020-56604\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56604\">Peak<\/a>. Once on board, they meet <a href=\"\/manifold-tyger\/4005-107456\" data-ref-id=\"4005-107456\">Manifold Tyger<\/a>, Brand, and Dr. <a href=\"\/cecilia-reyes\/4005-14177\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14177\">Cecilia Reyes<\/a>, who helped to examine the body of <a href=\"\/deathbird\/4005-6089\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6089\">Deathbird<\/a>.

After Storm managed to restore power to the Peak's engines (via intense lightning blasts), she passed out from the power exertion. Manifold Tyger, revealed to be a member of the Providian Order, then strangled Storm and nearly killed her. While recovering in the med bay Storm went into cardiac arrest but was saved by Jubilee and Dr.Reyes.<\/p><h3>Storm - Solo Series<\/h3><p style=\"\">Setting out to live by her own rules and use her powers for the betterment of humans and mutants alike Storm used her powers to save the island village of Santo Marco from a tsunami and, despite the political consequences, from a local anti-mutant militia. Her adventures also brought her in to a brief conflict with her former nemesis Callisto, took her back to Kenya where she met up with Forge to aid a local village suffering from drought conditions, and taking care of some of Wolverine's unfinished business with their mutual friend after his untimely death. While aiding Yukio, who had become the leader of several dangerous criminal clans, Storm was unexpectedly forced into fighting on her behalf in order to protect Yukio when her position as leader was challenged by a rival. After defeating the rival's champion in combat, though suffering some injuries, Storm secured Yukio's position as leader of the four clans.<\/p><p style=\"\">While still recovering from her injuries the passenger plane Storm was flying home on was attacked by one of the clans. Already being recognized and branded a terrorist by one of the passengers, who happened to be a U.S. senator, Storm managed to defeat the attackers and save the plane. However, upon landing the plane in NY Storm passed out from the strain of exerting her powers, and while she was unconcious the Senator made a publicized accusation that Storm was holding the passengers hostage and was terrorizing them. She was immediately arrested and taken into custody by the FBI. Seeing Storm arrested on television and that she was being held in a special FBI facility in Brooklyn her fellow X-Men reached out to Storm telepathically. Through Rachel's telepathic link Storm had explained that the plane was attacked by one of the criminal clans, Eaglestar, and that she was being framed by them. Rachel also informed Storm that a large crowd of people had come to protest her arrest and were outside of the facility she was being held in.<\/p><p style=\"\">Unsuccessful with trying to convince the FBI that she was being framed and that the mastermind behind the attack was Davis Harmon, who was believed to be dead to the world at large, Storm was forced to break free and find him herself. After making a daring escape Storm, through the assistance of the X-Men, found the senator who falsely accused her. Scaring him into confessing and revealing the whereabouts of Davis Harmon Storm had to elude the FBI a second time and made her way to San Francisco. Diving under the bay Storm found Harmon raiding the remnants of Utopia. Refusing to surrender Storm forced his large vessel to the surface of the ocean and easily defeated him. After explaining to Storm why he tried to frame her he made a final but unsuccessful attempt to kill her by detonating his vessel. The explosion created a massive tidal wave that threatened to kill the people on the Golden Gate bridge, but Storm creatively vaporized it before it could reach the bridge. She then turned Harmon over to the FBI.<\/p><p style=\"\">After having a special thieves adventure with her good friend Gambit Storm returned to her duties as Headmistress of the Jean Grey School. Unexpectedly the school was attacked by one of the former students and residents of Utopia - the believed to be deceased Kenji Uedo. Explaining that he felt that Storm failed him Kenji used his powerful abilities to attack not only the entire school, both students and faculty, but was simultaneously attacking Callisto in New York, Forge in Africa, and one of her former student's Marisol Guerra at her home in Mexico by generating numerous monster clones around the globe. Using his psionically conductive body mass to channel additional energy Storm used her powers across the planet to simultaneously take out all of Kenji's monster clones, and then pulled Kenji, Callisto, Forge, and Marisol into the astral plane via taking control of Kenji's psionic powers. There, instead of killing Kenji, she managed to pull off a psychic intervention and was able to spare his life.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/super-axis\/4060-55692\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55692\">Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS<\/a><\/h3><p style=\"\">After the initial events that led up to AXIS, Storm arrived with reinforcements, including <a href=\"\/colossus\/4005-1460\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus <\/a>and <a href=\"\/nightcrawler\/4005-1461\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler<\/a>, to battle the <a href=\"\/red-skull\/4005-2250\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Onslaught<\/a> and the two sentinels in his control, both of which were created by <a href=\"\/iron-man\/4005-1455\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark<\/a> and designed specifically to take down heroes. Storm, along with all the other heroes, except for Iron Man, was taken down by the Red Onslaught. After <a href=\"\/scarlet-witch\/4005-1466\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Wanda Maximoff<\/a> and <a href=\"\/doctor-doom\/4005-1468\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr. Doom<\/a> were able to cast their inversion spell, Storm and the other heroes reappeared, though some of them - including Storm - were noticeably different. After becoming darker as a result of the inversion spell Storm joined her fellow X-Men, and all were under the leadership of Apocalypse. They were trying to retrieve the Red Skull's body, who had part of Xavier's conciousness inside it but the Avengers refused to turn him over. This brought Storm and the mutants into conflict with the other inverted heroes and villains. Later the inversion spell was reversed and Storm was restored to normal.<\/p><h3>Guardians of the Galaxy &amp; X-Men: The Black Vortex<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4425133-7662941567-t013..jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4425133\" data-ratio=\"0.56093489148581\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4425133-7662941567-t013..jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4425133\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11119\/111191377\/4425133-7662941567-t013..jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11119\/111191377\/4425133-7662941567-t013..jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Storm vs Gamora<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">A mysterious artifact of vast cosmic power was discovered in space by the villainous Mister Knife, the father of Peter Quill. The Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde stole the artifact from Quill's father, and brought it to the Planet Spartax. Kitty asked her friend and teammate, Illyana Rasputin aka Magik, for help. Magik teleported to the Jean Grey School with the All-New X-Men. There she briefly explained the situation to Storm and Beast before teleporting them with her to Spartax. Once on the planet, the group argued over what to do with the artifact. Storm was in favor of destroying it. Some of the others, most importantly Gamora, were not. During their discussion, the Slaughter Lords arrived and attacked the assembled X-Men and Guardians. During a brief engagement, Gamora used the Black Vortex and became cosmically empowered. With her new abilities, she took down all of the Slaughter Lords on her own, giving Magik enough time to teleport the group away to Spartax's moon, where the argument continued. Beast also used the Black Vortex on himself, and Angel soon followed. They urged the others to do the same, but they would not. The cosmically empowered heroes wanted to take the artifact, but Storm would not allow it, leading to a short battle, during which Storm took on the empowered Gamora. After their altercation, the three transformed heroes left the planet with the Vortex. Mister Knife finally located the group and unleashed a fierce bombardment on the heroes gathered on the moon. It was initially thought that the heroes were wiped out by this attack. However, Kitty was able to reach Storm and one other, using her intangibility to spare them from the attack. Magik saved the rest of the group with some quick teleportation. Magik also cast a spell of intangibility to block the group from the view of the others.<\/p><h3>Extraordinary X-Men<\/h3><p style=\"\">With the release of the terrigen mist into the earth's atmosphere the mutants faced a new deadly threat. The toxic properties of the mist was not only deadly to the mutants, but also sterilizes the carriers of the X-gene. In an effort to save the earth's remaining mutants and fight for her species place in the world Storm created a sanctuary, X-Haven, and assembled a new team of X-Men that includes Magik, Colossus, Iceman, Nightcrawler, Forge, teenage Jean Grey, and Old Man Logan. After Storm's team saved Nightcrawler, Colossus, and Magik from the clutches of Mr. Sinister Ororo addressed the world, announcing X-Haven as a safe house for all mutants, and declared that the X-Men will find and save all mutants, retaliate against any persecution, and fight to protect all life - mutants, humans, and inhumans alike.<\/p><h2>Powers<\/h2><h3>Weather Manipulation<\/h3><p style=\"\">Multiple times over the years Storm has been called a \"sculptress\". This is one of many ways to describe her absolute mastery and dominion over the forces and elements that govern weather. In the blink of an eye Storm can alter her perception to perceive the elements of nature, including the planet's magnetic and electromagnetic field, and the ozone layer, as patterns of force and energy. She becomes one with these forces and can mold them to her will for a variety of effects. These atmospheric forces include (but are not limited to) air, moisture, temperature, pressure, and electrical energy. Through molding these forces Storm can manifest any meteorological tempest, weather effect, and other atmospheric phenomena with a thought. This also includes control over ocean currents.<\/p><p style=\"\">She has summoned powerful blizzards, thunderstorms, monsoons, tornadoes, hail, and hurricanes, as well as disbursed natural storms to create clear weather. Her range has been shown to be planetary but she can also localize the weather effects to a specific area or target, even manipulating air and electrical forces inside a target\u2019s body. Storm has also shown that she can channel these elemental forces through her own body, allowing her to project weather-effects in a beam-like path from her hands, such as lightning, wind, thermal energy, and moisture. Her control over air also gives her the power of flight.<\/p><p style=\"\">Due to her powers being tied to her emotions and because she is completely in-tune with the environment, she must keep a tight rein on her emotions to avoid them influencing the surrounding weather. Being acutely attuned with the biosphere of the planet Storm can sense various changes within the atmosphere and earth, including unnatural shifts in the air, movement within the earth, changes in the earth's electromagnetic field, or shifts within the water's currents. She has sensed objects as small as a snowball being tossed her way or the Blackbird cutting across the atmosphere from thousands of miles away.<\/p><h3>Adaptation<\/h3><p style=\"\">As Storm goes into different environments her powers adapt, including other planets and dimensions, allowing her control over the atmospheres in these different environments. For example, in space she can manipulate energies of stars and the solar wind. She can also summon atmospheric lightning while in space (though she can generate bioelectric lightning bolts through her metabolism). When in space she needs no medium for her lightning to travel and the raw power of her bolts are significantly enhanced, and has summoned a bolt big enough to cover a space ship.<\/p><h3>Potential<\/h3><p style=\"\">It should be noted that Storm currently has the label of \"Omega Level Potential\" that has yet to be confirmed. As such, she may have a vast and ever evolving range and array to her mutant powers that is yet untapped.<\/p><h3>Skills<\/h3><p style=\"\">Storm is a gifted, cunning and formidably skilled hand to hand combatant, trained by <a href=\"..\/..\/achmed-el-gibar\/29-26034\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Achmed El Gibar<\/a> and the Black Panther in her youth, and extensively trained by her fellow X-Man Wolverine. She is a master thief, lock pick and escape artist, has the same degree of dexterity in her toes and mouth as she does with her hands, and her reflexes, balance and coordination have been said to be far above normal. She is highly skilled with wielding knives, is experienced with a bo staff and has received training in swordfighting by the finest warriors in Wakanda. She is also an excellent marksman with a gun. She is very intelligent, a skilled and resourceful tactician, and possesses strong natural leadership skills, having lead the X-Men for years prior to and after her marriage to the Black Panther and her time as queen of Wakanda.<\/p><h3>Mystical Heritage<\/h3><p style=\"\">Ororo is the descendant of a long line of African Priestesses and Sorceresses that had white hair, blue eyes, and strong magic potential. This line of women has been around since the dawn of Atlantis. While there have been many of them, the exact number of the women who possessed Ororo\u2019s unique features is still unknown. Due to the fact that Storm possesses the signature markings of a witch (blue eyes and white hair on her maternal side) you can assume has inherited latent magic abilities. To this day, Storm still has not shown the mystic aspects of what she could have inherited, but she does embrace the \u201cBright Lady\u201d, The Goddess of her ancestors who is also know as the <a href=\"..\/..\/vishanti\/65-27218\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vishanti<\/a> member, <a href=\"..\/..\/oshtur\/29-27220\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oshtur<\/a>, the source of her ancestors magic. Storm has used her latent ability as a priestess to successfully invoke her name. Out of the entire line of women, only 3 have been brought up. Ayesha, a Sorceress Supreme who was possibly the first to hold the High Priestess title, <a href=\"..\/..\/ashake\/29-42895\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ashake<\/a>, a very talented Egyptian sorceress who appears to have also been High Priestess of her time, and another \u201cWind Rider\u201d who was confirmed by Andreas deRuyter and his father. Like her ancestor, Ayesha, Storm also possesses the title of this era\u2019s High Priestess. But she shares the title equally with <a href=\"..\/..\/scarlet-witch\/29-1466\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scarlet Witch<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/agatha-harkness\/29-3327\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Agatha Harkness<\/a>. Storm now has great mystical power that she could develop in a matter of days.<\/p><h3>Claustrophobia<\/h3><p style=\"\">Storm is one of the most powerful mutants and members of the X-Men, however, she suffers from claustrophobia (the fear of narrow or enclosed spaces), due to the experience as a child of being buried alive beside the dead bodies of her parents. When she had fallen victim to claustrophobic attacks in the past, she lost control of her powers. However, over time Storm has learned to manage her fear through sheer force of will and with mental exercises taught to her by Professor X.<\/p><h2>Status<\/h2><ul><li><b>Known Relatives<\/b> : Ayesha, ancestor (deceased), <a href=\"\/ashake\/4005-42895\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42895\">Ashake<\/a> , ancestor (deceased), Mr. Munroe (paternal grandfather), Harriet Munroe (paternal grandmother), unidentified Kenyan maternal grandmother, David Munroe, father (deceased), <a href=\"..\/..\/ndare-munroe\/29-42526\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">N\u2019dare Munroe<\/a> , mother (deceased), Vivian Munroe (deceased), Colonel Shetani (maternal uncle), David Evan Munroe Jr. (nephew), <a href=\"\/black-panther\/4005-1477\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">T'Challa<\/a> aka Black Panther (Ex-husband), Ramonda (Ex-mother in law) <a href=\"\/shuri\/4005-58997\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58997\">Shuri<\/a> (Ex-sister in law), <a href=\"..\/..\/syan\/29-59942\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S'yan<\/a> (Ex-uncle in law)<\/li><li><b>Citizenship<\/b> : American<\/li><li><b>Place of Birth<\/b> : New York City, New York<\/li><li><b>Marital Status<\/b> : Divorced<\/li><li><b>Occupation<\/b> : X-man, Adventurer; former Former Queen of Wakanda, gladiator, thief, tribal patron<\/li><li><b>Characteristics<\/b><\/li><li><b>Gender<\/b> : Female<\/li><li><b>Height<\/b> : 5'11\"<\/li><li><b>Weight<\/b> : 145 lbs.<\/li><li><b>Eyes<\/b> : Blue, glowing white when utilizing her powers.<\/li><li><b>Hair<\/b> : White<\/li><\/ul><h2>Alternate Realities<\/h2><p style=\"\"><i>For more information, see:<\/i> <i>Marvel Multiverse<\/i>.

Her home continent, Africa was in turmoil following the rise of the mutant tyrant Apocalypse. Following this, Storm called herself the Windrider and declared a small section of Africa for herself to intended to keep it safe from the war brewing between mutants and humans. However, her plan backfired as the small section of Africa she was protecting actually made her and the people within stand out. Apocalypse took advantage of this and attacked the small nation and captured Storm to turn her into a Horseman. She was taken to Mr. Sinister and the Dark Beast where she was branded and made into a warrior for Apocalypse. It was here that Apocalypse gave her the codename 'Storm'.<\/p><p style=\"\">While she was within Dark Beast's lab, she was subjected to torture and the Shadow King's mind- controlling telepathy. However, Storm was able to resist the Shadow King's mind control and managed to summon a large storm that wiped out all of the power within Apocalypse's lands. During the loss of power, Prelate Scott Summers found Storm and feeling sympathy for her helped her escape the labs. While Storm was heading back to Africa, she was confronted by Quicksilver whom she though was a spy for Apocalypse. As she was about to electrocute him with lightning, Quicksilver explained that he was actually a member of the X-Men and he earned her trust. Later on, Storm became romantically involved with Quicksilver.<\/p><p style=\"\">Storm join the X-Men team and kept the code name Storm to remind her of what she had been through with Apocalypse. She was selected to join Quicksilver's X-Men team and was sent to help destroy the Sentinels that were created by the Human High Council in evacuating North America. While the team were within America, they were confronted by the Brotherhood and Abyss, who was a Horseman of Apocalypse, and their leader. Storm managed to defeat Abyss and his Brotherhood by luring Quicksilver out into the open.<\/p><p style=\"\">Upon completing the evacuation, the X-Men team were sent back to their headquarters in Westchester. While there, they discovered that Apocalypse attacked their headquarters and captured Magneto, Charles and Bishop. Along with Quicksilver, Storm travelled to the Mandri Temple to rescue Bishop. They managed to find and rescue Bishop and they also managed to free Jamie Madrox, who was responsible for the creation of the Madri Cult. To stop the Madri surviving, Jamie shut down his own mind. Along with the rest of the X-Men team, Storm travelled to New York City to confront and defeat Apocalypse once and for all. They were successful in doing since then Storm and Quicksilver have developed their relationship and continue to fight for Magneto's vision of coexistence. After a decade of Apocalypse\u00b4s defeat, it is revealed that Storm became a loyal herald of the new Apocalypse (Weapon X).<\/p><p style=\"\">(See: <a href=\"..\/..\/x-men-chronicles\/49-18037\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men Chronicles<\/a> #1-2, <a href=\"..\/..\/x-men-alpha\/49-18051\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men: Alpha<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/astonishing-x-men-1995\/49-5536\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Astonishing X-Men<\/a> #1, <a href=\"..\/..\/amazing-x-men\/49-5535\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazing X-Men<\/a> #1-4, Age of Apocalypse 10th Anniversary One-Shot, Age of Apocalypse 10th Anniversary #1-6.

The survivors hid in tunnels beneath Central Park to evade Ultron's forces. When the group traveled to the Savage Land, Storm provided mist and fog as cover in tandem with the Sue Storm's invisibility and Emma Frost's psychic cloaking. The group discovered a secret bunker built by Nick Fury, who later revealed himself to them. There was a time machine inside the bunker. He proposed that a team be taken into the future. Storm was one of the selected few. She used her powers to carry the team through the air from the Savage Land (which was unexpectedly verdant) to New York City, which had been transformed into a technological masterpiece. They were detected immediately upon their arrival by Ultron, who sent hundreds of drones to attack the group. After a fierce battle for their lives, each of the heroes, including Captain America, Black Widow, Quake, Iron Man, and Red Hulk, was hurt, and presumably, died. .<\/p><h3>Earth-58163 (House of M)<\/h3><p style=\"\">After the Scarlet Witch lost control of her powers and warped the Earth 616 reality, Storm's history and connection to the world changed. She did not meet Charles Xavier and later join the X-Men. Instead, while in her teens, she ventured to Africa, where her developing mutant powers emerged, and the legend of the Windrider grew across the continent. During this time, she met T'Challa. Storm used her powers to save T'Challa from a mutant attack on the young prince's kingdom of Wakanda. During that time the two fell in love, and T'Challa eventually proposed to her but Storm refused him. Over the subsequent years Storm used her powers for the good of Africa, using her powers to quell human-mutant conflicts throughout the continent and promote peace, and helped to end a civil war that erupted in Kenya. As a result, the Kenyan people embraced Storm as their queen. Storm played a pivotal role in Magneto's successful victory over the rest of Africa, though not Wakanda, and installed leadership in Africa, but allowed Storm to remain as queen of Kenya. Storm had helped to turn Africa into a world power, making Africa into the world's breadbasket. And, in addition to Africa's rising power, Storm's promotion of peaceful relations between humans and mutants gave Magneto great concern and brought her into conflict with him. To address this, Magneto instructed Quicksilver to court Storm, though the two of them developed genuine feelings for each other. However, due to Storm's distaste for Magneto's rule and that Pietro supported his father's philosophy, she did not pursue a relationship with him. Storm, as well as Sunfire, Namor and Blackbolt, rulers of their respective lands, was secretly working with T'Challa, whom Magneto had been trying to eliminate. After T'Challa killed the latest assassin, Sabretooth, Magneto sent in Apocalypse and his Horsemen to kill the Black Panther. As part of T'Challa's secret resistance, Storm takes down Apocalypse's airship and engaged Iceman, one of Apocalypse's Horsemen. A shot time later, at a large gathering to celebrate and honor the House of Magnus, Wanda changed the world back to normal but also eliminated 99% of the world's mutant population. Storm was one of the few remaining mutants who retained her powers.<\/p><h3>Earth-1298 (Mutant X)<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/615335-bloodstorm_mx.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-615335\" data-ratio=\"2.3952095808383\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:239.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/615335-bloodstorm_mx.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-615335\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/615335-bloodstorm_mx.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/615335-bloodstorm_mx.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Storm of the Earth-1298 reality (Mutant X), is known as Bloodstorm after being bitten by <a href=\"\/dracula\/4005-7206\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7206\">Dracula<\/a>.

Before judgment can be passed, <a href=\"..\/..\/wolverine\/29-1440\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine<\/a> realizes that Gambit's fate should be decided in a trial by combat.

Jean-Luc explained that he had no idea where Gambit had been, especially since the X-Men had dropped him in the Antarctic. The Angel and Psylocke then realized that Jean-Luc could only have known about the Antarctic had he spoken to Gambit. Jean-Luc begged for the X-Men to leave Gambit, as he could have died in the Antarctic, but the Angel and Psylocke claimed that it wasn't enough suffering for he had done to them.<\/p><p style=\"\">Soon after they left the club, Angel and Psylocke were confronted by Wolverine, who reminded them that X-Men don't kill. Angel replied that it was funny coming from Wolverine and the X-Men also don't freelance to <a href=\"..\/..\/mr-sinister\/29-3179\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mister Sinister<\/a>. Wolverine agreed that Gambit screwed up big time, but Angel and Psylocke were not helping by going off on their own. He then warned that if the entire team didn't have a say in Gambit's judgment then he could not see the X-Men staying together as a team. Later, as Gambit awoke in <a href=\"..\/..\/paris\/34-56052\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paris<\/a>, Jean-Luc called Gambit and warned him that he had just been visited by some of the X-Men.

He noticed that Rogue was looking up the Antarctic in an atlas and reminded that she couldn't punish herself because of the crimes Gambit had committed. Their conversation was soon interrupted by the Beast, who wanted to know what was keeping them.<\/p><p style=\"\">At the meeting, Storm informed the others that Wolverine, Angel, and Psylocke were towards Paris, where they believed Gambit was hiding.

While Marrow argued with Maggott, Maggott's maggots ate their way through the door, revealing their presence outside. Storm invited the three newest X-Men into the room, where she announced that the X-Men had decided to send a team to Paris to pass final sentence on Gambit. In Paris, Gambit walked the streets, where he was attacked by Psylocke. As he tried to battle her, Angel arrived as well. The duo soon cornered Gambit, who explained that he had been cornered before and lived to tell about it. At that time, Storm and the other X-Men arrived on the scene to battle Gambit. Before Marrow could kill Gambit, Rogue knocked her away and Storm put a vote on the fate of Gambit. Bishop voted imprisonment, Marrow voted death, Iceman voted exile, but Wolverine explained to them that it was the Morlocks who suffered most from Gambit's actions. He suggested that Gambit's fate be decided by a trial by combat, as the Morlocks would have done. Marrow was the first to want to battle Wolverine, but the Angel announced that his hostility was more personal. Marrow then agreed to allow the Angel to battle Gambit. The two battled furiously until the Angel managed to pin Gambit to the ground, but he then let Gambit go free instead of killing him. The other X-Men prepared to let Gambit go, but Marrow killed Gambit anyway, unable to just let what she saw as a killer go free.<\/p><p style=\"\">As Gambit died, he begged Rogue not to kiss him as that would allow her to absorb Gambit's feelings of guilt and cause her more emotional pain. Gambit dies, but not before urging the X-Men to come together and stop letting his own crime tear them apart.

Using his Cerebro machine, Prof. X found Ororo in Athens, Texas where she'd been stealing cars for a living. When she took a 1978 Mustang for a joy ride, the police finally caught up with her. Pulling her over, Ororo used her powers to create a lightening storm so as to escape. Unfortunately, her control of her powers was limited, and she almost killed a group of children playing in a nearby playground; the police officers then subdued her. Per orders of Xavier, Jean Grey used her abilities to convince the Athens authorities that Ororo was actually an FBI agent and that she was sent to relieve them of the mutant. At first Ororo believed that Jean was another of Magneto's henchmen (apparently she had been contacted previously with an offer to join his Brotherhood), but Marvel Girl was there to offer her a place amongst Xavier's X-Men- a team of mutants gathered to halt the undeniable war that was brewing between humans and mutants whilst better mutants' standing in society.<\/p><p style=\"\">Ororo joined the team not only to help further human\/mutant relations, but also to gain control of her powers. Shortly after joining the X-Men, Ororo, who was given the codename <b>Storm<\/b>, became interested in and began a relationship with fellow X-Man Henry \"Hank\" McCoy. She and Beast remained together for some time, until Beast was killed during a mission. Beast's untimely death led Storm to become belligerent, bitter, and angry; she even drastically changed her personal appearance, altering her style to a punk-inspired look. After Beast's death, Storm took much time to heal emotionally. Eventually, Storm began to flirt with fellow X-Man Wolverine. Initially, Wolverine rejected her, saying that he was to old for her. Later when Wolverine leaves the X-Men Storm follows him and brings him back. When it is later revealed the Hank McCoy is still alive, Storm and Hank rekindle their relationship. The happiness doesn't last long, as Hank dies aging in the event of Ultimatum.

Her parents married far too early in their relationship. In an attempt to fix their decaying relationship, Priscilla got pregnant. Nine months later she birthed a baby girl that she named Anna-Marie. Unfortunately the young couple was whisked into a nature-loving commune where they joined in an insane plan to reach \u201cthe Far Banks,\u201d a dreamland from Native American mythology, where the rules of the physical world no longer applied. The commune hired a shaman to take them to the Far Banks, but something went horribly wrong during the ceremony. Owen had planned to sacrifice Priscilla to the spirits of the Far Banks, but she took control of them and closed the mystical place behind her as she vanished.

Rogue was one of the few X-Men characters whose real name had never been revealed until a long time after their first appearance (see also <a href=\"\/wolverine\/4005-1440\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine<\/a>). In the X-Men films, Rogue's real name is Marie. In the comics, however she called herself Anna Raven when her powers were deactivated. Her real name was finally revealed in her solo series \"Going Rogue\" in flashbacks of her Aunt Carrie and her mother, who called her Anna Marie.<\/p><p style=\"\">Most recently Rogue has been shown to have control over he powers and she can now touch people and decide if she wants to take their powers or not, and has been featured in a more solo role in the <a href=\"\/x-men-legacy\/4050-20691\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20691\">X-Men Legacy<\/a> series.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2078357\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/95970\/2078357-679726_rogue03.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.97\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/95970\/2078357-679726_rogue03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2078357\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/9\/95970\/2078357-679726_rogue03.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/9\/95970\/2078357-679726_rogue03.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Rogue's first meeting with her foster mother, Mystique<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Mystique took Anna home with her where she introduced the teenager to <a href=\"\/destiny\/4005-3557\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3557\">Irene Adler<\/a> ( <a href=\"\/destiny\/4005-3557\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3557\">Destiny<\/a>), Raven\u2019s lover. In a few short weeks Anna grew to trust the two women, and she would expose herself as a mutant; what was most shocking to her was that her foster mothers themselves were also mutants. With this information she grew to further trust them, and even love them. It was with them she met her closest friend, another mutant girl her age who called herself <a href=\"\/blindspot\/4005-14588\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14588\">Blindspot<\/a>, her powers allowed her to erase anyone\u2019s memories by touching them. Her powers seemed to counteract Anna\u2019s mutation and they were able to safely touch each other, which pleased Anna to no end because this made her feel normal.She felt pressured by Mystique to join her terrorist group, The <a href=\"\/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants\/4060-17652\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17652\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants<\/a>, but Anna wanted a normal life. When Anna was dared to kiss a boy named <a href=\"\/freddy\/4005-70856\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70856\">Freddy<\/a>, her powers kicked in and she drained him too. After that she would never speak to him again, and with no sign of a normal life ever being possible she joined Mystique and The Brotherhood. Anna frequently tested her limits. <a href=\"\/mystique\/4005-1469\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\">Mystique<\/a> often needed to keep her in line, as Anna took her powers too lightly and enjoyed using her abilities for fun. Anna also dyed her naturally white streak brown, only to replace it with two white streaks on her temples, apparently in an attempt to look older.<\/p><p style=\"\">During their final mission together, they were hired to travel to <a href=\"\/japan\/4020-55746\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55746\">Japan<\/a> and break into the house of <a href=\"\/lord-dark-wind\/4005-19384\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19384\">Lord Dark Wind<\/a>, the father of <a href=\"\/lady-deathstrike\/4005-8470\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8470\">Lady Deathstrike<\/a>. They were to steal his plans for the <a href=\"\/adamantium\/4055-40759\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\">adamantium<\/a> bonding process. In order to succeed, they had to team-up with <a href=\"\/sunfire\/4005-3175\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3175\">Sunfire<\/a>. During the mission, Sunfire was knocked out and Anna took his flame powers. She loved flying and wanted to keep these abilities, but they quickly faded, although not before Anna destroyed major parts of Dark Wind\u2019s estate. Although they hadn\u2019t accomplished their actual mission, the Brotherhood still classified this as a victory, and to celebrate, Blindspot took a picture of Mystique, Anna and Sunfire with Dark Wind\u2019s burning property in the background. Back home, though, Mystique had enough of Blindspot and exiled her from the group. In order to protect herself, Blindspot erased Mystique\u2019s, Anna\u2019s, and everyone else\u2019s memory of her to move on without being recognized. Life went on for Rogue, Mystique and Destiny as if nothing had happened. In time, Destiny received precognitive visions that warned her about the Avenger known as Ms. Marvel costing Rogue her soul one day.<\/p><p style=\"\">Destiny discussed this with Mystique, who then vowed to not allow it, even if it would kill her. Anna, only hearing the last part, decided she would hunt down Ms. Marvel herself in order to protect her mother. However, Ms. Marvel had vanished from Earth and the <a href=\"\/avengers\/4060-3806\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers<\/a>\u2018 active roster, having been taken to <a href=\"\/limbo\/4020-42990\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42990\">Limbo<\/a> by Marcus, was nowhere to be found. When Mystique\u2019s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants made their public debut, Destiny had convinced Mystique to keep Rogue back from the mission as a failsafe. Destiny proved to be correct, for all of the Brotherhood, except Mystique who was captured in their first mission by the <a href=\"\/x-men\/4060-3173\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men<\/a>. During this incident Anna learned that Carol had returned and was now living in San Francisco.

Anna found that, somehow, her metabolism had permanently retained Ms. Marvel's mind and powers. Fearing for her own sanity and identity, since she kept hearing Carol's voice in her head, Anna threw her body off the bridge, hoping that her physical death would also kill the voice in her head. Unfortunately for Anna, she was rescued by <a href=\"\/spider-woman\/4005-1453\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1453\">Spider-Woman<\/a>, who brought Carol to a hospital where <a href=\"\/professor-x\/4005-1505\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Charles Xavier<\/a> could partially restore her memories. Under Mystique\u2019s guidance, Anna proceeded to attack the Avengers one by one, absorbing the powers of <a href=\"\/thor\/4005-2268\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor<\/a> and <a href=\"\/captain-america\/4005-1442\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America<\/a>, with Raven impersonating <a href=\"\/nick-fury\/4005-3202\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury<\/a>, she tried to free the rest of the Brotherhood from prison. However, the remaining Avengers and Spider-Woman prevented the breakout. As most of her stolen powers were already fading, Anna escaped with Mystique to avoid being captured as well. Several weeks later, the X-Men sneaked into the <a href=\"\/the-pentagon\/4020-55834\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55834\">Pentagon<\/a> with Carol to delete their data files. In one of the corridors, they ran into Anna, who was there thanks to Mystique's secret identity as a government agent. Immediately, a fight started and Anna absorbed both <a href=\"\/wolverine\/4005-1440\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine<\/a> and <a href=\"\/storm\/4005-1444\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm<\/a>\u2019s powers.<\/p><p style=\"\">After regaining consciousness, Storm created an air vortex to carry Rogue away, as she did not want to endanger the <a href=\"\/the-pentagon\/4020-55834\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55834\">Pentagon<\/a> personnel by a fight. Soon, Mystique tried once more to release her teammates from prison. Anna and Mystique easily defeated the guards, but <a href=\"\/rom\/4005-2189\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2189\">Rom<\/a> (the Spaceknight), discovered the breakout. He easily rendered the <a href=\"\/blob\/4005-3182\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3182\">Blob<\/a>, <a href=\"\/pyro\/4005-3554\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3554\">Pyro<\/a> and <a href=\"\/avalanche\/4005-3553\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3553\">Avalanche<\/a> unconscious, because they fought unorganized. Mystique angrily decided to leave them in prison for a while longer. Searching for new allies, Mystique, Destiny and Anna found <a href=\"\/hybrid\/4005-45621\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45621\">Hybrid<\/a> (a half-human, half- <a href=\"\/dire-wraiths\/4060-14015\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14015\">Dire Wraith<\/a>) and offered to team up with him against their common enemies, Rom and the X-Men. In combat with Rom, Rogue touched his Galadorian armor and absorbed some of his inherent nobility in the process. When Hybrid revealed his plans to turn the entire Earth, including mutants, into his slaves and cattle, the mutant trio opposed him before fleeing. While Rom battled Hybrid alone, Rogue showed the potential for goodness for the first time, as she went back against Mystique\u2019s orders, finding she could not bring herself to leave without helping the Spaceknight. Wanting revenge on the X-Men for having spoiled their plan to assassinate <a href=\"\/robert-kelly\/4005-15026\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15026\">Senator Kelly<\/a>, Mystique and her partners assaulted <a href=\"\/angel\/4005-2112\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">During the fight, Rogue was supposed to absorb the knowledge of the X-Men\u2019s whereabouts from Angel\u2019s mind but she did not want to use her powers on him, as the wings were a physical mutation and Rogue feared what effect that would have on her. While distracted with their own problems, <a href=\"\/dazzler\/4005-1498\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1498\">Dazzler<\/a> took Anna and Mystique by surprise with her light powers. Anna then developed a grudge against Dazzler, the woman who had everything that she wanted. Having been a fan of her music before, she now saw that <a href=\"\/dazzler\/4005-1498\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1498\">Alison Blaire<\/a> had also a controllable mutant power and a beautiful boyfriend. Slowly, the personality and memories that Anna had permanently absorbed from Ms. Marvel began to overpower Anna\u2018s mind, affecting her control and her sanity. Finally, after seeing that Mystique clearly couldn't aid her with these problems, she turned to Charles Xavier and the X-Men.<\/p><h3>Becoming an X-Man: A Fresh Start<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666926-roguegreatest1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666926\" data-ratio=\"1.5325\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666926-roguegreatest1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666926\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666926-roguegreatest1.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666926-roguegreatest1.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Rogue joins the X-men<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Shortly after moving into the X-Men's headquarters, Anna changed her hair back to its original style with the single white streak, to reflect her inner change and to support the idea of a fresh start. Naturally, the X-Men were suspicious of the former enemy among their ranks, especially Wolverine, who was good friends with Carol. However, slowly but surely, Rogue gained the X-Men\u2019s trust, by risking her own life to save Wolverine\u2019s fianc\u00e9, <a href=\"..\/..\/mariko-yashida\/29-3196\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mariko Yashida<\/a>. Naturally, Mystique noticed that Anna had left the house and, before long, she tried to get her daughter back. While the Brotherhood kept the rest of the X-Men busy, Mystique infiltrated the mansion and knocked out Xavier. She believed that he must have mentally controlled Anna to make her abandon the Brotherhood, but after Rogue stated that it was her own choice to join the X-Men, considering that Xavier might be her last chance to control her power, Mystique reluctantly agreed and left.<\/p><p style=\"\">Rogue found a message from Colonel Mike Rossi, asking for help. Rogue immediately went to help him and rescued him from the <a href=\"..\/..\/shield-helicarrier\/18-40700\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SHIELD Heli-Carrier<\/a>. Without realizing it, she accessed memories and personality traits of Carol Danvers, and even her voice and accent changed. She had stolen the very identity of Carol Danvers, everything that had made her the person she was, was forever lost to Carol and locked away in Rogue\u2019s head. After being framed for murder, the government planned to use a prototype power neutralizer on Rogue. Rogue was still struggling against the Ms. Marvel personality that was still inside her. Mystique learned of this in her guise as a governmental employee, and Destiny's prediction of the danger. They alerted Storm to Rogue\u2019s whereabouts and after she had found her, Storm and Rogue finally sorted out their differences and Ororo proved her trust by volunteering to let Rogue absorb her power. Rogue was tempted to permanently absorb the weather abilities but resisted, not wanting to betray the trust placed in her.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/mutant-massacre\/4045-41407\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41407\">Mutant Massacre<\/a><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666927-198279-100586-rogue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666927\" data-ratio=\"0.84\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:84.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666927-198279-100586-rogue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666927\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666927-198279-100586-rogue.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666927-198279-100586-rogue.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Rogue and the X-men in Mutant Massacre<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Suddenly <a href=\"..\/..\/henry-gyrich\/29-9711\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henry Gyrich<\/a> and his forces attacked and it became painfully clear that Mystique had not revealed the full extent of Destiny\u2019s vision.

With Storm incapable, <a href=\"..\/..\/nightcrawler\/29-1461\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler<\/a> became temporary leader of the team, and he tried to test Rogue for the seventh sense that Ms. Marvel had possessed.

In the final battle, the X-Men's physical and spiritual essences were used as fuel for <a href=\"\/forge\/4005-4279\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\">Forge<\/a>'s energy star, which closed the doorway to the Adversary\u2019s plane of existence and saved the <a href=\"\/marvel-multiverse\/4020-45892\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45892\">multiverse<\/a>.

Their own super powered agents, the <a href=\"\/press-gang\/4060-56450\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56450\">Press Gang<\/a>, captured Rogue and Wolverine and the unthinkable happened as <a href=\"\/wipeout\/4005-28583\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28583\">Wipeout<\/a> fully canceled both of their abilities. For the first time in years, Rogue was able to experience skin to skin contact, though it now happened against her will. Thanks to a special form of digitalized teleportation, Rogue arrived naked to the prison of Genosha, and the guards took a few liberties when they put her into a cell. Rogue completely withdrew into her subconscious. There, she found out that some psychic residue had remained of all people she had absorbed and now these phantoms tried to overwhelm her. As Anna was fighting for sanity and control within her mind, unexpected help was provided by the permanently absorbed personality of Carol Danvers. She was more than the psychic residue, in fact, she was as solid and real as Rogue. As Carol, with her spy training, was more suited for escaping from the prison without any superpowers, Rogue let Carol take over. From then on, Carol and Rogue agreed on a new modus operandi - the two personalities would actually share the body, with each having their times of dominance, or acting as back up when one was rendered unconscious. It also seemed that Carol had no trouble to keep the absorption power under control. While she was using the body, she touched <a href=\"\/psylocke\/4005-3176\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Psylocke<\/a>'s bare skin without any effect.

It was said that everyone who entered the magical portal would be judged by the highest of powers, the good and ill of their lives being weighed in the cosmic balance, only to be reborn into a new life without remembering the old one.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h3>Battle of the Personalities<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666928-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666928\" data-ratio=\"1.5457746478873\" data-width=\"284\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 284px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666928-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666928\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666928-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666928-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Rogue VS Ms. Marvel<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Weeks later, Rogue emerged in her room in the Australian Outback town with her memory completely intact. At first, she thought that the whole explanation of cosmic balance and second chances was a hoax, but then she discovered that she no longer had Carol\u2018s abilities and memories. She was now ground-bound and vulnerable. Suddenly she was attacked by Ms. Marvel. It seemed that the Siege Perilous had attempted to separate the two women and provide each one with a body her own, but there wasn't enough life-force to sustain both of them. Rogue tried to escape through Gateway\u2019s portals and was sent to the <a href=\"..\/..\/savage-land\/34-21766\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Savage Land<\/a>. Ms. Marvel meanwhile ended up on <a href=\"..\/..\/muir-island\/34-43505\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Muir Island<\/a>, after being possessed by the <a href=\"..\/..\/shadow-king\/29-14889\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow King<\/a>, she followed Rogue and continued the battle. Whoever had the upper hand of the battle was healthy, while the other withered away. Rogue was about to give up, since she didn\u2019t want to \u201ckill\u201c Ms. Marvel for a second time, when suddenly <a href=\"..\/..\/magneto\/29-1441\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magneto<\/a> stepped in. He rendered both, and when Rogue woke up, Magneto had used machinery to drain\/kill Carol\u2018s body and restore Rogue to full power, without the Carol personality in her head.

Their first mission of the new team involved battling Magneto, the man she might have loved, but the master of magnetism didn\u2019t listen to any of Rogue\u2019s attempts to convince him to stop the fight and attacked her without remorse. Gambit was a man of secrets and mysteries. Just like Rogue, he kept his real name secret, only for the time-traveling X-Man, <a href=\"\/bishop\/4005-1503\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\">Bishop<\/a>, to reveal it as <a href=\"\/gambit\/4005-1499\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1499\">Remy LeBeau<\/a> and accuse him of becoming a traitor to the team. Though she knew neither man well, Rogue sided with Gambit in this conflict, reasoning that Gambit couldn\u2019t be held accountable for something he had not yet done. However, when later that day a woman showed up at the X-Men\u2019s doorstep, claiming to be Gambit\u2019s wife, she was not sure about trusting Gambit anymore. He explained himself, that the woman was <a href=\"\/bella-donna\/4005-7896\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7896\">Bella Donna Boudreaux<\/a>, a member of a rival guild from <a href=\"\/new-orleans\/4020-55684\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55684\">New Orleans<\/a>, and while Gambit had indeed married her, he had not seen her in many years and considered their relationship long over.<\/p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/stryfe\/4005-7616\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7616\">Stryfe<\/a>\u2018s assassination attempt on Xavier with a special form of the <a href=\"\/techno-organic\/4015-43631\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43631\">techno-organic<\/a> virus united all of the X-Teams to hunt the villain down during the <a href=\"\/x-cutioners-song\/4045-42178\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42178\">X-Cutioner\u2019s Song<\/a>.

Temporarily blinded, Rogue was taken off the active roster and took some time to recover.

Rogue offered to tell Gambit her real name but he declined, saying that names didn't say anything about who a person is. Not much later, Gambit was called back to his home to avenge his brother's death and Rogue accompanied him. During their stay in New Orleans, she accidentally absorbed part of Bella Donna's mind and was flooded with the memories of the happy times she spent with Gambit \u2013 kissing, touching and loving one another \u2013 all things denied to Rogue. For a split-second, Rogue was tempted to touch Bella Donna again and permanently absorb it, but she reminded herself that it was wrong and the absorption wore off.

Bella Donna decides to take revenge on Rogue for stealing memories from her when she lay in a coma and kidnaps Cody. Rogue finds out, but is too late. Bella Donna promises to do the same with everyone else Rogue holds dear, just to make her pay.

Later, Rogue and Gambit relax in a forest. Rogue makes Gambit promise not to follow her anymore, but he can\u2019t keep his promise after he learns that Bella Donna is behind the attacks.

Candra threatens Bella Donna and makes her promise to kill Rogue, and in return Candra promises to make things the way they were before. If not, Candra will kill Bella Donna and all the other Guilds.

As Gambit wouldn\u2019t confide in her and outright tell her what his dark secret was, Rogue reasoned that, if they couldn't trust each other, they also couldn't love each other.

He wanted to atone for his crime and deemed this an appropriate punishment.<\/p><h3>Back Home<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666937-uncanny348.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666937\" data-ratio=\"1.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666937-uncanny348.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666937\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666937-uncanny348.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666937-uncanny348.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Rogue and Remy after Gambit\u00b4s Trial<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">At one point, Rogue was given the chance to have her powers removed. She had learned of the Agee Institute through TV news and found that Dr. Agee really was capable of removing the mutant gene. When Mystique learned of Rogue\u2019s plan, she became rather angry with her daughter. However, despite all of Mystique\u2019s warnings, Rogue still was about to undergo the treatment, only declining in the last instant for one sole reason, she feared that the device would be used on other mutants against their will, and without her strength, she would have had no way to make sure that the apparatus would be destroyed after her operation. She made the decision to destroy the machine, which could have given her a normal life. Driven by guilt, Rogue secretly sneaked out of the mansion and flew in search of Gambit, yet she found no trace of him or the mysterious fortress where the trial took place. Eventually, Gambit ran across some of the X-Men and returned with them, having been granted a second chance. When Rogue and Gambit finally reunited it wasn't quite the reconciliation they had in mind, when Gambit was stranded in Antarctica to save his life he shared a bond between a mutant being called <a href=\"\/mary-purcell\/4005-47441\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47441\">Mary Purcell<\/a>, in time she fell in love with Gambit and became over protective, when she had found out that Rogue was his true soul-mate she lashed out on the both of them during and outing Rogue and Gambit were on, they defeated her and Rogue asked Gambit yet again if he really loves her and due to the secret that Gambit was hiding he was unfortunately unable to answer, she departs and lets him know that she cannot wait forever.<\/p><h3>The Hunt For Xavier<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666938-50324-4605-65781-1-x-men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666938\" data-ratio=\"1.525\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666938-50324-4605-65781-1-x-men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666938\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666938-50324-4605-65781-1-x-men.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666938-50324-4605-65781-1-x-men.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The hunt for Xavier<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">During their search for Professor X, the X-Men were required to split up into two different teams, as there were separate locations that could possibly lead to the destination of their mentor. Rogue was assigned to the team who were headed to Tajikinistan, and as they journeyed to the apparent location of Charles they found it wasn't Charles who was there after all but a little girl named <a href=\"\/nina\/4005-12078\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12078\">Nina.<\/a> Her guardian told the X-Men and Rogue how they managed to come to Tajikinistan and how there was a link between Nina and Charles. After they all managed to explain themselves the X-Men and Rogue were assaulted by a sentient <a href=\"\/cerebro\/4055-15073\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\">Cerebrite Alpha<\/a> that had somehow fused with their ally <a href=\"\/colossus\/4005-1460\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Collosus<\/a>. Rogue was required to leave the battlefield and help support Nina and her guardian, and as the raging battle went on Nina alerted Rogue that Storm was apparently dead. As shocked as Rogue was she knew it could not be true so she went to see if she could assist Storm and Gambit in their fight with the Cerebrite Alpha but it was too late, Storm was nowhere to be seen and Gambit was unconscious in the arms of the sentient Cerebrite Alpha. When Rogue saw that Gambit was in for a fatal blow she knew she could not let that happen, and she successfully managed to rescue him out of the clutches of the sentient Cerebrite Alpha, but at a price. During the fight her gloves somehow got cut which allowed her to make skin to skin contact with Gambit, in the process releasing the mutant being Mary Purcell who was still hiding within Gambit even after her previous encounter with her, with Rogue wondering what exactly it was that had just happened she was distracted and left open for a full on attack by the sentient Cerebrite Alpha in the process allowing Nina to be captured by it.<\/p><p style=\"\">A day later while the battle for Xavier had reached almost a fierce finale for the other team over in San Francisco they realized the only way for them to find their supposedly dead teammates would be to \"kill\" themselves too. Having done this Nightcrawler was keeping a close watch on the teammates he thought had just been slaughtered mysteriously, and assumed that all hope was lost unless he somehow managed to get back to Rogue's team in time. Even though they had never answered his previous calls he managed to find them, and soon they were off to go help the fight for Xavier. Rogue, Colossus, Gambit and Nightcrawler formed an assault team to help save the Professor. Rogue and Colossus proved to be formidable opponents against the Cerebrite Alpha, but soon the whole team was put into the containment pods. Nina saw that the only way she could possibly help was to help make Charles whole again and in the process bring back his telepathic powers. This proved to be successful and during the ordeal \"Rogue and the X-Men\" freed themselves of the containment pods, the Cerebrite Alpha stated that it never planned on killing those X-Men but to make it's \"Dream\" a reality now needed to do so. It brought out the <a href=\"\">Xavier Protocols<\/a> and almost immediately they were set to destroy. The \"X-Men and Rogue\" had begun to die out before Charles' eyes and under a minute were dead, but little did the Cerebrite Alpha know that the team of mutants that had just been slaughtered were not the X-Men but robotic clones of them, the real X-Men and Rogue were by Charles' side and he made a telepathic rapport between all of them to strike at the specific targeted areas of the Cerebrite Alpha to destroy it once and for all. They were successful in its defeat and removal.<\/p><h3>Magneto Again<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666941-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666941\" data-ratio=\"1.5129032258065\" data-width=\"310\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666941-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666941\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666941-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666941-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Rogue in Genosha<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After the Magneto War and Joseph's funeral, Rogue was left behind while the other X-Men were abducted for a journey through time and dimensions. She flew to Genosha, now under Magneto\u2019s rule, to try and reason with the man she came to know as a friend once more. Yet, after aiding Quicksilver and the Genosha Cabinet in fighting off the Mutate known as <a href=\"\/zealot\/4005-50961\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50961\">Zealot<\/a>, Magneto ordered her to leave or face criminal charges. When the team returned, Xavier began to become mentally unhinged. Xavier pushed the X-Men too far and Storm called in Scott and Jean to reason with the Professor. They failed to help Xavier, who then dissolved the X-Men and told them to go their own way, since he had no use for failures. The majority of the team left on personal vacations and Storm stayed behind to keep Xavier from harming himself.<\/p><h3>Apocalypse and the High Evolutionary<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666944-descarga.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666944\" data-ratio=\"1.5027322404372\" data-width=\"183\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 183px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666944-descarga.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666944\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666944-descarga.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666944-descarga.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Shattering<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Rogue, Nightcrawler and <a href=\"\/kitty-pryde\/4005-3548\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Shadowcat<\/a> began their vacation. During this time, they met up with Mystique, who was on the run from the Japanese government. She was being tracked by Sunfire, but Rogue managed to convince Shiro that Mystique was innocent of the murders she was being charged with.<\/p><p style=\"\">After settling things with Mystique and Sunfire, they received a call that Wolverine had been killed on the surrogate X-Men's mission to save the <a href=\"\/mannites\/4005-15061\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15061\">Mannites<\/a>. At the mansion, Xavier revealed that he had pretended to lose control in order to uncover a traitor in their midst. The traitor was discovered when Wolverine's deceased body reverted to its true form; that of a Skrull warrior. The true Wolverine had been kidnapped months ago by <a href=\"\/skrulls\/4060-40668\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrulls<\/a> working with <a href=\"\/apocalypse\/4005-7612\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\">Apocalypse<\/a>, who was brainwashed into being his Horseman of Death. However, the X-Men were able to snap him out of the mental hold and also stopped Apocalypse\u2019s plans to extract the energies of the mutants, only referred to as the <a href=\"\/the-twelve\/4060-47547\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47547\">Twelve<\/a>, which would have granted him omnipotence.<\/p><p style=\"\">Weeks later, the <a href=\"\/high-evolutionary\/4005-13346\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13346\">High Evolutionary<\/a> activated an anti-mutation wave that switched off the mutant gene in everyone across the planet. Finally completely normal, Rogue worked for her law degree and tried to get Mystique out of jail. However, Rogue refused to use criminal methods to get her mother out of jail. When the X-Men learned that the anti-mutation wave was going to reverse itself and horribly mutate the entire world Rogue immediately returned to the team to stop the disaster. They raided the Evolutionary's satellite, disabled the anti-mutation field and defeated Sinister, who had been manipulating the Evolutionary. With her powers active again, Mystique soon broke out of prison and vowed vengeance on Anna for abandoning her in her time of need.<\/p><h3>Leader<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666946-rogue-bigcostume10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666946\" data-ratio=\"1.498127340824\" data-width=\"267\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 267px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666946-rogue-bigcostume10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666946\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666946-rogue-bigcostume10.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666946-rogue-bigcostume10.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Rogue in X-men Revolutions era<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">About six months later, Rogue was elected the new field leader for an X-Men squad.

Her style varied a lot from Storm\u2019s and Cyclops\u2018, who usually chose to play it safe. During the crisis known as <a href=\"..\/..\/maximum-security\/39-49092\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maximum Security<\/a>, Earth was turned into a penal colony for alien prisoners.

Rogue drove off the attackers but Z'Cann was critically wounded. The Skrull girl deliberately made contact with Rogue, transferring her memories of Xavier's plans to the mutant. With this information, the X-Men managed to meet and rescue Bishop, who had returned from deep space. Unfortunately, Z'Cann was unfamiliar with Rogue\u2019s powers, and to make sure that the information would be received, she had even boosted Rogue\u2019s absorption power with her own telepathy. As a result, her Skrull deviant genes mixed with Rogue's half- <a href=\"..\/..\/kree\/65-7588\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kree<\/a> physiology in an unexpected manner. Rogue was now capable of calling forth the memories and abilities of anyone she had absorbed in the past. She could not control this manifestation of her powers and would spontaneously sprout claws, fire optic blasts or adapt organic steel skin. She gained some self-control through meditative training with Wolverine but, because of the disability her new powers gave her, Rogue stepped down as team leader.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/dreams-end\/4045-56127\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56127\">Dream's End<\/a><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666947-943417-250252_159816_rogue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666947\" data-ratio=\"0.88266666666667\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666947-943417-250252_159816_rogue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666947\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666947-943417-250252_159816_rogue.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666947-943417-250252_159816_rogue.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Rogue VS Mystique<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Around the same time, Mystique led the Brotherhood in another attempt to kill Senator Kelly and spread the <a href=\"..\/..\/legacy-virus\/12-42281\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legacy Virus<\/a> to humans only.

She used a blade on Rogue\u2019s gut, causing a serious wound that would have been fatal, if Rogue had been without Wolverine\u2019s healing abilities. Rogue recovered quickly and returned the \u201cfavor\u201c on Mystique, inflicting a similar, critical knife wound. Still, victory was too late, as Moira MacTaggert died because of the injuries received when the Brotherhood blew up her lab complex. As a result of this conflict, Rogue and the X-Men learned of Destiny's journals, a collection of diaries written by the deceased precog that depicted the future of mutant kind.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/x-treme-x-men\/4050-9411\" data-ref-id=\"4050-9411\">X-Treme Team<\/a><\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-287456\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5648\/287456-150150-rogue.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.3068592057762\" data-width=\"277\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 277px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:130.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5648\/287456-150150-rogue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-287456\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5648\/287456-150150-rogue.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5648\/287456-150150-rogue.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>X-Treme X-Man<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">During her time on the <a href=\"..\/..\/x-treme-x-men\/40995\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Treme X-Men<\/a> team, led by Storm, Rogue requested <a href=\"..\/..\/sage\/4559\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sage<\/a> use her powers to help evolve Rogue so she could control the powers that she absorbed.

She also inherited a mansion from Destiny and the X-Treme team stayed there to recuperate from the fight. Rogue and Gambit became powerless and they decided to leave the team in an attempt to help develop their relationship. Rogue and Gambit had a bit of trouble running into mutants that hated homo-sapiens, and they started a fight with Rogue and Gambit and beat them. The two ended up residing in a beach house at Valle Soleda where both mutants and humans lived peacefully together.

Rogue would eventually encounter her mother\u2019s spirit and set it free. She returned to her Aunt Carrie and told her that she considers her a mother. Rogue went along with Sunfire to investigate a photo of her and Sunfire doing criminal activities. She learned that Blindspot had erased her memories. She also accidentally absorbs Sunfire\u2019s powers permanently. Blindspot erases Rogue\u2019s memories again which caused her to engage in a battle with the X-Men.<\/p><p style=\"\">Rogue returned to the X-Mansion but found that Gambit was being seduced by Foxx.

When her squad of X-men took Pandemic down they freed Anna, but she was too weak to do anything and had to be hospitalized on Cable's island, while a new threat was released from within the mind of <a href=\"..\/..\/lady-mastermind\/29-12055\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Regan Wyngarde<\/a> (Lady Mastermind) called the <a href=\"..\/..\/hecatomb\/29-74334\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hecatomb<\/a>. With the other X-Men, barely surviving an attack from the Hecatomb (as Sabretooth ran off with their ship), Cable's mind merged with a Shi'ar species that wanted to destroy the Hecatomb. The two had no other choice but to wake Anna from her comatose state of mind. She easily defeated the alien by absorbing its powers and memories, since the Hecatomb had already taken in so many lives and Shi'ar species beforehand. Although she had recovered, she now seemed to have a hunger to absorb the people around her. As they now were not part of the mansion, the X-Men took refuge in Mystique\u2019s home, where they were attacked by the new Marauders, including Lady Mastermind and Mystique, the latter shooting Anna in the stomach. Things weren\u2019t looking up for Anna; she was half dead, her team now consisted of Iceman and <a href=\"..\/..\/cannonball\/29-1496\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cannonball<\/a>, and she was carried off by the enemies that blind-sided her.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/messiah-complex\/4045-48995\" data-ref-id=\"4045-48995\">Messiah Complex<\/a><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666948-tumblr_inline_mrsz8vwsb91r24r6r.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666948\" data-ratio=\"1.334\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666948-tumblr_inline_mrsz8vwsb91r24r6r.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666948\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666948-tumblr_inline_mrsz8vwsb91r24r6r.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666948-tumblr_inline_mrsz8vwsb91r24r6r.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Mystique tries to save Rogue<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">It was made clear that her purpose was to give Sinister <a href=\"..\/..\/destinys-diaries\/18-44250\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Destiny's Diaries<\/a>, since she had been the only one who had read most of them. At the Marauder's base, Mystique revealed her decision to betray the X-Men was so that the brilliant geneticist Mr. Sinister would help her daughter. Mystique and Gambit, concerned about Anna\u2019s survival, confronted Sinister, and he confirmed that she would soon die. Enraged when Sinister refused to put any effort into curing Anna, Mystique forced his cheek against Anna's, using Anna's augmented powers to kill him instantly. Upon Gambit's arrival with the baby (the first known mutant birth since <a href=\"..\/..\/m-day\/12-41003\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-Day<\/a>, later named <a href=\"..\/..\/hope-summers\/29-49329\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hope<\/a>) Mystique states that it was revealed in Destiny's Diaries what she had to do. Following through with Destiny's prophecies she pushed baby Hope against Anna's cheek as a means of healing her dying daughter. While at first there doesn't seem to be any effect, minutes later, Anna wakes up. By doing this, Hope erased all the psyches and powers Anna had absorbed throughout her life. Anna, realizing her mother put an innocent baby's life on the line (even if to cure her), then turns on Mystique, stating that no one is ever safe whenever Mystique is around, and not knowing that Hope has cured her, she touches Mystique's face (intending to kill her) causing her foster mother to collapse to the ground. However, this backfires, and Anna is trapped, having only her own psyche combined with the thoughts of her worst enemy, her foster mother Mystique, in her mind. While Gambit tries to comfort her, she pushes him away, stating that she needs her space and time alone and if he truly cared, he\u2019d give it to her. She then leaves Gambit alone at the Marauders \/ Mr. Sinister\u2019s base.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/manifest-destiny\/4045-55673\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55673\">Manifest Destiny<\/a><\/h3><p style=\"\">In Manifest Destiny, in an attempt to gain control over her powers and life again, Anna traveled to Kooroowi. Heading on motorcycle to the abandoned X-base, she reflects on the entirety of her experiences as an X-Man. In the course of her reflection and meditation, Anna is continually interrupted by the presence of Mystique\u2019s psychic personality echo that was left in her mind. The pair trade words several times, each time with Anna affirming that, though she\u2019s aware that Mystique still cares for her, she'd still prefer not to have a psychic echo in her head giving her advice or making her doubt herself.

Anna grants her access to the town on the condition that she is left in peace. When the anthropologist interrupts her some time later, asking her about some technological debris she discovered, Anna claimed to be ignorant despite knowing that it likely came from one of the X-Men's battles with the <a href=\"\/reavers\/4060-9726\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9726\">Reavers<\/a>. Growing tired of her waiting game, the anthropologist reveals that she is well aware of Anna's identity, confirming Anna's original suspicions that the woman wasn't who she pretended to be. Unfortunately a third party interrupted their interaction: a crew of Shi'ar pirates seeking to obtain a technological find of great value. Anna is to soon learn that her guest is not Mystique, her original suspect; but the AI known as <a href=\"\/danger\/4005-40862\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40862\">Danger<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Danger reveals that she had originally intended to use Anna in her foremost revenge plot against Xavier. However the resulting battle soon has Anna, Danger, Xavier and Gambit working collectively to force the Shi'ar pirates to flee Earth. It is in this process that Danger resolves her conflict with Xavier, and explains why Anna was never able to gain control over her mutant powers.<\/p><p style=\"\">Danger stated that it was the traumatic damage of the incident that sent Cody into a lifelong coma that was the first in a series of subconsciously built psychological barriers formed in Anna\u2019s mind to help her cope with the her guilt.

When the process was concluded, Anna awakens to feel her skin tingling, a feeling she compares to having every cell being on fire. Anna removes herself for several hours of meditation, as she explores the new sensations of having a free mind. When she\u2019s ready, she asks Gambit to help her test her control. She gently kisses him, without experiencing any involuntary energy absorption.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/utopia\/4045-55905\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55905\">Utopia<\/a><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666951-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666951\" data-ratio=\"0.70347957639939\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666951-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666951\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666951-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666951-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Rogue VS Moonstone<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In Utopia, on their approach to San Francisco, Anna, Gambit and Danger are intercepted by <a href=\"..\/..\/pixie\/29-40673\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pixie<\/a>, who teleports them into the city, which happens to be in a state of sheer chaos due to the conflict of the clashing anti-mutant and pro-mutant movements.

During the early stage of this mission, Anna faces off against dark Ms. Marvel ( <a href=\"..\/..\/moonstone\/29-3279\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moonstone<\/a>) finding that she cannot even touch her opponent (due to Ms. Marvel\u2019s ability to become intangible) Anna tricks her and quickly escapes the battle. Anna is soon forced to confront Ares, who dismisses both her opposition, and her attempts to gain control of the situation and calm everyone down. Anna is quick to grab <a href=\"..\/..\/ares\/29-11940\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ares<\/a> and absorbs his powers. Ares initially is dismissive of her attack and claims that she could not absorb him, a boast that proves to be wrong as she weakens him enough for him to be susceptible to Gambit\u2019s energy blasts, leaving him bloody and stunned. For the moment, having absorbed Ares' celestial powers, Anna easily dispatches a small assembly of <a href=\"..\/..\/hammer\/65-56065\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">H.A.M.M.E.R.<\/a> agents, and along with Gambit and Danger, proceeds to steal their tank in order to find the rest of the students.

Anna attempts to help calm Trance enough for her to gain control, when Ms. Marvel appears. After taking out Gambit and Danger, Anna is forced into another battle with Ms. Marvel. Anna is losing, until Trance is able to regain control, jumping in to lend a hand. Trance learns that her astral form is in fact able to touch Ms. Marvel when they\u2019re both intangible.

She meets with <a href=\"\/surge\/4005-40509\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40509\">Surge<\/a>, who explains that her power is going out of control whenever she is around Magneto, and asks Rogue to talk to him about it. Rogue meets up with Gambit and thanks to her temporary psi-power, sees something inside him that shouldn\u2019t be there. She tries to get him to talk about it, but Gambit doesn\u2019t want to. Suddenly, images of Rogue and Gambit\u2019s sexual past flash through Rogue\u2019s mind and are projected to everyone across <a href=\"\/utopia\/4020-56536\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56536\">Utopia<\/a>, embarrassing her.<\/p><p style=\"\">Rogue suggests to <a href=\"\/indra\/4005-40671\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40671\">Indra<\/a> that she could use the telepathy to go inside his mind, but he is not interested.

Rogue tells him that he cannot do that without Surge\u2019s permission, and then they kiss. Rogue knows it is because of the telepathy, and warns Magneto once again to back off from Surge. Rogue talks to <a href=\"\/rockslide\/4005-40456\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40456\">Rockslide<\/a> about fear, before picking up someone else thinking about her. She sees <a href=\"\/iceman\/4005-1464\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman,<\/a> but he assures her he was thinking about baseball.

Indra tells Rogue that he doesn\u2019t want to be a fighter, before almost uncontrollably using his powers to armor up and confront Rogue with a multitude of weapons, a power he's never displayed before.

Anna attempts to find her, but is instead confronted by Proteus, who has possessed Blindfold and resurrected Destiny. After Proteus fully possesses Blindfold's body, he takes each X-Men down one by one, with the exception of Colossus, whom is thrown all the way to the X-Jet. In the end, Proteus possesses Nightcrawler as well. Proteus learns he can control more than one body at the same time. Cautiously, Anna chooses not to take chances, and absorbs Nightcrawler's powers, teleporting herself and everyone else outside of <a href=\"\/moira-mactaggert\/4005-8304\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\">Moira\u2019s<\/a> old lab. The X-Men are finally able to locate <a href=\"\/colossus\/4005-1460\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus<\/a> (who is unconscious inside the remnants of the X-Jet) when Proteus arrives once again, possessing the bodies of Destiny, Nightcrawler and Blindfold.

Leaving Anna and Magneto by themselves, Erik is quick to use his powers, throwing Colossus at Proteus. Anna absorbs Betsy's powers and uses the psy-knife on him, but to no effect. Magneto then uses his powers to lift a piece of magnetized rock with him and Proteus (in Blindfold's body) on it, taking the fight to outer space. Anna, using Psylocke's powers, breaks Proteus' psychic hold on everyone, except for Husk. Meanwhile, Magneto throws up a magnetic shield against Proteus (Blindfold), so that he can't possess Erik\u2019s body. Proteus, upset, takes them back to the ground. When Husk is close enough to touch Anna (which would give Proteus control over Anna\u2019s body), Psylocke arrives and uses her psi-knife on Paige, setting her free from Proteus\u2019 possession. Proteus and Magneto continue on fighting, when Erik reveals he's been distracting Proteus in order to understand his energy pattern, as he's made of pure energy, electrons. This way, Magneto is able to purge Proteus out of Blindfold's body, dispersing him completely. Psylocke asks him where Proteus is, to which Magneto replies that he doesn't know and that Proteus will come back sooner or later. Anna and Destiny meet at the shore. Irene tells her she will be dead before the day is out, but that she's proud of her daughter. Destiny also implies that Rogue is bound to Hope in ways that matter, and with that, they say a finale goodbye. Magneto hits on Rogue again, but Anna is quick to put him in his place. The X-Men are able to fix the Blackbird enough so that they can finally leave the island.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/second-coming\/4045-55971\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55971\">Second Coming<\/a><\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1199119\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5648\/1199119-2.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.4298409728718\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5648\/1199119-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1199119\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5648\/1199119-2.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5648\/1199119-2.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Mass Absorption<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In Second Coming, after Cable and Hope are again detected in the present, Cyclops assigns Anna and <a href=\"\/namor\/4005-1476\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor<\/a> to stay and defend Utopia in the case of an attack.

He then tells her that out of all the woman he has ever loved in his life none have compared to Rogue, and continues by saying that he is not a station for Rogue to come and stop at on the path of her life but her home and her end point and that when she is ready to realize this she will come to him, but until then she should not come at all.<\/p><p style=\"\">Later on Rogue takes some time by herself but is accompanied by Magneto whom she makes clear to that she is not in the mood for anyone at the moment, he then admits that only 3 people in Utopia would he voluntarily seek their companionship and Rogue begin one of the ones that concerns him the most at the moment, she tells him that she does not want to be around him because she is unable to sort out the feelings that Legacy had for Magneto in The Age Of X, he was her anchor in her time of need, Magneto tries to cheer her up and tells Rogue that his counter part the General had feelings for Legacy too, Rogue's goes on to say that Magneto is nothing like the General and that their relationship is not relevant to what was happening there and then, she then goes on to say that Magneto is at his most dangerous when he seems more than willing to help someone she then asks if there is anything else about him that she needed to know, he replies with \"Yes, many things\" she tells him that it was a rhetorical question, Magneto moves closer on the subject and tells her that they were put together in The Age Of X for a reason, Rogue argues against that by saying that Moira wrote the \"script\" of everything that happened there, and that it was not by their own free will but she then gives and and tells Magneto she will talk with him, he takes her and they fly off, she asks where they are going to and he tells her \"The past\". Rogue and Magneto arrive at the National Holocaust Museum where he proceeds to tell her a \"parable\" that involves his past that includes killing a Nazi doctor at a very young age. Rogue asks what was the point of bringing her to the museum and telling her his story, to which he explains that he has done a lot of terrible things in his life most of which he does not regret and begins to tell her that The General was kind, noble, put other mutants before his pride, and says that The General everything that Magneto is not. He then tells her to go back to Gambit as her love \"enables\" him. Later, once they return to Utopia, Rogue decides that she wants to make her own decision, not one based on Gambit, Magneto, or Legacy\/Reaper's influence, about Magneto and their relationship, so that night she visits Magneto's room; telling him that she's \"too big to be afraid of the dark\" and that she \"can't\" promise anything beyond the night.<\/p><h3>Avengers vs. X-Men<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666958-rogue-vs-she-hulk-rogue-28983025-582-666.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666958\" data-ratio=\"1.1443298969072\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666958-rogue-vs-she-hulk-rogue-28983025-582-666.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666958\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666958-rogue-vs-she-hulk-rogue-28983025-582-666.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666958-rogue-vs-she-hulk-rogue-28983025-582-666.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>AVX: Rogue VS She-Hulk<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">During the midst of <a href=\"\/avengers-vs-x-men\/4045-56674\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56674\">Avengers vs. X-Men<\/a>, Rogue battles <a href=\"\/falcon\/4005-1451\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1451\">Falcon<\/a>,<a href=\"\/moon-knight\/4005-1493\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1493\"> Moon Knight<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/she-hulk\/4005-1449\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk<\/a> after a misunderstanding led to violence at the Jean Grey School.

The three were each targeted, isolated, then assaulted and kidnapped by the <a href=\"\/s-men\/4060-59400\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59400\">S-Men<\/a>, and taken to the Red Skull's Reeducation Camp on <a href=\"\/genosha\/4020-40967\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genosha<\/a>. Dampeners were placed by each of the three mutants to prevent them from using their mutant powers. However, Rogue, using the power of Simon Williams who is trapped in her psyche, was able to break free of her chains and inhibitor collar. She freed Wanda and Alex, and they discovered Magneto locked away and being tortured by one of the S-Men. After freeing him, the four mutants faced the Red Skull. In Magneto's rage, he killed the Red Skull by smashing his head in with a large piece of debris. In doing so, he unwittingly unleashed the Red Onslaught, a villain far more dangerous, with the telepathic mind of Xavier and the hatred and rage of Magneto. Just when all looked lost, reinforcements arrived in. Heroes from the ranks of the X-Men, Avengers, Inhumans, and the Fantastic Four came pouring into Genosha to defeat the Onslaught. The Red Onslaught released sentinels specially designed by Tony Stark to defeat heroes. These sentinels took down the heroes. Magneto returned with a cabal of villains who tore through the sentinels. Eventually, the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom were able to cast an Inversion Spell that reverted the Red Onslaught into the Skull, bringing the benevolence of Charles Xavier back to the forefront. Unfortunately, this also inverted the heroes and villains present on the island, including Rogue. With her new, more aggressive personality, Rogue and the other inverted X-Men pledged to follow the inverted Genesis (now, Apocalypse) into battle against the humans. When Mystique tried to convince the inverted X-Men not to go through with their plan to detonate a gene bomb, Apocalypse sent Rogue and Nightcrawler as his ambassadors to greet Mystique. They attacked their mother while she tried to talk them down. Rogue grabbed Mystique, flew high up into the air, and dropped her. Before Mystique could hit the ground, Sabretooth came leaping into the fray to save her. He and Mystique left before Rogue or Nightcrawler could do anymore harm. Rogue participated in the battle between the inverted Avengers, the inverted villains, and the inverted X-Men. With her powers, she was able to take on the likes of <a href=\"\/kluh\/4005-76698\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76698\">Kluh <\/a>and Medusa. Eventually, Doctor Doom, Brother Voodoo, Scarlet Witch, and the White Skull were able to undo the effects of the Inversion Spell, returning Rogue and the others to normal.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666964-descarga+%281%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666964\" data-ratio=\"1.4891304347826\" data-width=\"184\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 184px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666964-descarga+%281%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666964\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666964-descarga+%281%29.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666964-descarga+%281%29.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Rogue\u00b4s powers<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Rogue is a <a href=\"\/mutant\/4015-40656\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">mutant<\/a> with the ability to drain a living being's essence upon physical contact, giving them a biophysical shock while synthesizing into her body their physical skills, memories, personality traits, and superhuman matrices to a varying degree. Prolonged physical touch could be lethal to whomever she contacts. After some work with Danger and Professor X, she has gained control of her power.

She started the series working for <a href=\"..\/..\/weapon-x\/65-5018\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weapon X<\/a> and took part in their attacks on the X-Men. She later chose to join the Brotherhood. She eventually ended up joining the X-Men and started a relationship with Iceman.<\/p><p style=\"\">Later, Rogue met and fell in love with Gambit. She left Bobby and the X-Men to be with him. However Gambit was killed in a battle against the <a href=\"..\/..\/juggernaut\/29-1445\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Juggernaut<\/a> and Rogue permanently absorbed his powers. These powers allowed her to touch. She returned to the Mansion and reunited with Iceman. Later she lost Gambit's powers and gained back her own, after touching Nightcrawler and teleporting to different locations.<\/p><p style=\"\">When the team disbanded because of Professor Xavier's \"death\", Bishop attempted to recreate the X-Men and prepare them for the future. Bobby and Rogue declined, choosing to stay behind in the school opened by Jean and Scott. Later, Rogue took the drug <a href=\"..\/..\/banshee\/18-55849\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee<\/a> and displayed the ability to call upon powers she had formerly absorbed.

She then battled against Magneto, along with many other heroes, and used <a href=\"..\/..\/madrox\/29-7910\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Multiple Man<\/a>'s powers to change the tide.

Because Reed Richards was killed, Rogue and the other inhabitants of the world were forced to stay. Making peace with one another after many of them were killed, the heroes and villains settled down and had children. Somewhere along the way, Rogue began to have trouble with the personality of Carol Danvers, who presumably took the dominant role in controlling their shared body. She eventually became the wife of Steve Rogers, and was able to touch him because Carol was in control.

She is also a master thief, and has a somewhat different personality from her 616 version.

Killed by the same kiss that took Rogue's life. However, some time later when Beast was reflecting back at the fates of various members of the X-Men, he would recount that Gambit was killed by an assassin. Rogue, grief stricken, would travel to the <a href=\"\/savage-land\/4020-21766\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land<\/a> seeking out <a href=\"\/sauron\/4005-3180\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3180\">Sauron<\/a>, believing their similar powers would cancel each other out and cure her of her mutant ability. This plan was said to have backfired and Rogue was killed as a result.

The public eye has started subscribing to their activities and have liked them which increased their popularity<\/p><h3><b>X-Men Forever (Earth-161)<\/b><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666983-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666983\" data-ratio=\"1.6363636363636\" data-width=\"143\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 143px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:163.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666983-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666983\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666983-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666983-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>X-men Forever<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Rogue and the rest of the X-Men were involved in a battle with Fabian Cortez. When Rogue tried to attack Fabian during the fight, he grabbed her by the neck. (She later realized that when they made contact, it took away most of the thoughts she had absorbed of other people she had touched.) He then tore her right sleeve, and threw her at Storm, and they also made skin contact.<\/p><p style=\"\">After the battle was over and Fabian was defeated and captured, the X-Men returned to the X-Mansion. When <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Wolverine_(Logan)_(Earth-161)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine<\/a> died, it made everyone black out. Rogue was hit the hardest besides <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Jean_Grey_(Earth-161)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jean Grey<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">When the X-Men found out Storm was responsible for Logan's death, the X-Men battled and chased her. They split up into two groups, one with Rogue, <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Remy_Picard_(Earth-161)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gambit<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Kurt_Wagner_(Earth-161)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler<\/a>. When they arrived at a bridge near their destination, Gambit found Ororo, but she was much younger, and was not the Storm that they were chasing.<\/p><p style=\"\">After the X-Men found out about the Consortium and went to South America and found a secret facility making sentinels, they finally returned home again. But Rogue did not stay for long, because Nightcrawler got a call from an old friend who needed help in Jackson, Mississippi. Rogue offered to go along since she was from that area. When they got to the address, they found <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Raven_Darkholme_(Earth-161)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mystique<\/a>, who had faked the call. In anger, Rogue attacked her for always interfering with her life. Rogue is knocked out from an explosion during the ensuing fight.. Nightcrawler finds the unconscious Rogue and immediately administers CPR. Due to her powers being on overdrive, Rogue absorbs Nightcrawler so completely that she takes over not only his teleportation powers, but also his physical appearance. Rogue gains a tail, blue skin, and three fingered hands and feet from the experience. In this state, she no longer absorbs other people's memories and can in fact touch people with no effects. It is unknown if this mutation is temporary or permanent.<\/p><p style=\"\">When the X-Men faked their own death, Rogue escaped the X-Mansion and dealt with a robbery in New York. There, she ran into <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Peter_Parker_(Earth-161)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man<\/a>, and proceeded to spend the night accompanying him on patrol as she practiced with her new powers. Their time together also sparked a slight edge of romantic tension, the two of them nearly kissing, before they were interrupted by a telepathic scream from Jean Grey, who was searching for Rogue. Rogue came to Nightcrawler's rescue when her team was attacked by <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Neo-Sentinels_(Earth-161)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neo-Sentinels<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Earth-1025<\/h3><p style=\"\">In this universe Rogue was a part of the X-Treme X-Men and had a mission to look for the diary of Destiny, a precognitive mutant who once played an important role in Rogue's past.

She then used it and found out about an upcoming tidal wave.<\/p><h3>Earth-1031<\/h3><p style=\"\">In this universe Apocalypse had made improvements on Professor X's powers to unlock the potentials of mutants, but the process then killed him.

Her power is seemingly under control here as she can afford to have skin to skin contact with anyone. Rogue is also shown to have a few powers including, super strength, durability and flight.

She is romantically involved with Wolverine.<\/p><h3>Magnus Reality (Earth-27)<\/h3><p style=\"\">Rogue gave birth to Magnus, who grew up to have similar powers to Rogue except his touch turned objects into metal. She was seemingly killed by Magnus' touch a week after his thirteenth birthday, but turned out to be alive when his body returned to this reality.<\/p><p style=\"\">Rogue of Earth-27 is a member of the X-Men and is in a relationship with Magneto. Together they had a son,Magnus Lensherr. The birth was a complicated one, but young Magnus survived and the two parents happily raised the boy. Magnus was cursed with a mutant power that was a combination of his parent's abilities: gifted with amazing magnetic powers, he would unfortunately turn whoever he touched with his bare skin into metal. From a very young age he had to wear a skin suit to prevent this from happening.<\/p><p style=\"\">As an adult, Magnus was plucked out of his reality by theTimebreakers to be one of the founding members of the reality hopping Exiles. With his son suddenly vanishing without a trace, Magneto convinced himself that his son had run away from home.<\/p><p style=\"\">Magnus died on the Exiles first mission, and eventually his body was returned home to Rogue and Magneto. They were shocked, and at first Magneto would not believe that the charred remains were his son. However, Rogue confirmed it was their boy, and showed Magneto the note left by the Exiles telling them that their son had died a hero. Magneto and Rogue quickly arranged a funeral for their dead son.<\/p><h3>Marvel Noir<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666988-x-men-noir-jean-grey.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666988\" data-ratio=\"0.726\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4666988-x-men-noir-jean-grey.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4666988\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666988-x-men-noir-jean-grey.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4666988-x-men-noir-jean-grey.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Rogue\u00b4s body in X-men Noir<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In this reality, Rogue is known as Anne Marie Rankin and was a student of Professor X.

In this animated series, she had her absorption powers, as well as Ms. Marvel abilities. She has a love-hate relationship with Gambit throughout most of the series, much like when they first met in the comics, but also shows a more flirtatious attitude towards numerous other characters, such as <a href=\"\/angel\/4005-2112\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Archangel<\/a>, Colossus, and during the X-Men's appearance on <i>Spider-Man: The Animated Series<\/i>, she flirted with, and kissed <a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man<\/a> (with his mask on). She is also depicted with a stronger Southern Accent than in other animated portrayals. During the series, Rogue almost takes the 'cure' which Apocalypse and Mystique secretly used to make mutants into their slaves. However, Rogue does not take the cure. She is also revisited by Cody, her first boyfriend, and almost runs away with him when she finds that she can touch him. She soon finds out, however, that he was part of a plot to have Rogue become the new leader of the <a href=\"\/brood\/4060-4987\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4987\">Brood<\/a> (referred to here as \"the Family\"). She attempts to convince him to come back with her to the mansion to help reverse his transformation, but fails in her attempts, leaving her to cry on Gambit's shoulder. Rogue was also present when <a href=\"\/lilandra\/4005-6144\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6144\">Lilandra<\/a> had to take Professor Xavier up to space with her.

So her powers make her cynical and reclusive, but truthfully, she is consumed by the desire to get close to the people around her ( but unable too beacuse of her power and not being able to touch anybody ). She was raised by Mystique and Destiny, soon being brought into the Brotherhood of Mutants, but left when she found out that they nurtured her to be a potential weapon. Rogue has a strong interest in <a href=\"\/cyclops\/4005-1459\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops<\/a>, though her feelings for him fade soon after he and Jean start dating. She is then shown having an interest in Gambit when they first met, when he kidnapped her, and when she kissed him in the season 3 finale (while under <a href=\"\/mesmero\/4005-5065\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5065\">Mesmero<\/a>'s control). This was one of only two kisses to be seen in the series, the first being between <a href=\"\/scarlet-witch\/4005-1466\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch<\/a> and a disguised <a href=\"\/toad\/4005-1470\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1470\">Toad<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Rogue's energy-absorbing abilities are very strong in this series, nearly driving her insane, but prove vital in the final episode against Apocalypse. Unlike in other universes, the powers she absorbs never totally fade, and at times, can still use a mutant's power (not always intentional) long after she had absorbed them. At times, she had more control over absorbed powers than their natural owner had (after absorbing Cyclops' power, she did not have to close her eyes). Although this Rogue did not have super-strength or flight abilities, she displays some skill in hand-to-hand combat. She is never shown gaining Ms. Marvel's abilities, but in Xavier's vision of the future, she is seen flying and not wearing gloves, suggesting contact with Ms. Marvel. Her accent is less pronounced than in the previous Animated portrayals and was said to be paired with Scott in this future. She was voiced by Meghan Black.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/wolverine-and-the-xmen\/4075-6\" data-ref-id=\"4075-6\">Wolverine and The X-Men<\/a><\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-706449\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35492\/706449-rog.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.59789473684211\" data-width=\"475\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 475px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35492\/706449-rog.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-706449\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/35492\/706449-rog.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/35492\/706449-rog.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Wolverine and the X-Men<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Rogue was severely distressed with Wolverine's departure. She stated to friends that the Institute would not be a home for her without Logan. For that, she got mad at Logan.

During <a href=\"\/robert-kelly\/4005-15026\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15026\">Senator Kelly's<\/a> speech introducing the <a href=\"\/sentinels\/4060-4296\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinels<\/a>, a Sentinel detected Rogue and attacked her.

Rogue became a valued member of the Brotherhood in some of their missions, striking up a close friendship with Domino, the only other female on the team. Rogue was also assigned to absorb the memories of Angel's father to learn the whereabouts of Senator Kelly in order to put an assassination on him. Thus, it ruined her friendship with Angel. Throughout her stint with the Brotherhood, Rogue and Domino bond, and swap their views on mutant kind. Domino is also the only one who treats Rogue as a human being, rather than a weapon, like Pietro. Pietro and Rogue are not very good allies during Rogue's Brotherhood stint. He treats her unfairly, and has a knack of annoying her. Eventually, Rogue comes to her senses, and betrays the Brotherhood, but not without answering to Domino. The ladies leave on bad terms, their last meet was with Rogue absorbing her powers and knocking her out. Rogue rejoins the X-Men, leaving Domino without an answer and the Brotherhood one member less. She helps Wolverine fight the <a href=\"\/silver-samurai\/4005-3174\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3174\">Silver Samurai<\/a>, and meets his former love, <a href=\"\/mariko-yashida\/4005-3196\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3196\">Mariko Yashida<\/a>.

It was a multidimensional projection of the real Layla that was the main reason why Jaime could not sense Layla\u2019s body temperature. As the intense light materializes, they wake up in some kind of medical facility. Layla was still pluged to a machine with cables connected around her body. A gigantic sentinel emerges through the ceiling. The sentinel is ready to fire a full bore laser blast towards both of them.

Layla joins Jaime for a long walk on the boardwalk. The sunset begins to set down, they argue about the reasons why they have being a part of each other. They question their motives. Time has passed quickly without them doing what is necessary to be together. As they shout at each other, they drawn themselves closer and with each word they get really closer. Finally, they kiss. As Jaime tries to break away, he gives excuses and reasons to rationally stop. Layla talks to him to calm him out; she explains that the good thing about being involved with her is that he does have to guess about everything anymore.<\/p><p style=\"\">Later, they are reunited with Cyclops who asks Jaime to investigate the lost track of some members of the Summer Rebellion.

She notices marks on his upper body. She wants to know about the marks, they share a moment of truthfulness as he explains the events of him reabsorbing Teresa\u2019s baby. She attempts to console him. The whole situation is observed by Cyclops and Ruby who are at edge of the door. Cyclops mocks Jaime and tells him about the first time he meet Layla.

He knows that they want to know more about the time gaps. He demands that Layla knee in his presence to show some respect. Layla plays along. Van Doom forces her to knee by bending his hand but in reality Layla is just role playing along with him because Von Doom\u2019s advanced age is an impediment. He can not force Layla against her will using just his physical stamina. Ruby and Jaime notices her strategy. Victor Von Doom explains that the only effectively way affect to change the future is to have a Doomlock. The device allows impacting any change of your actions in that particular time stream. Layla asks him how she can get one. He explains that you need to be a cybernetic organism to be able to use it because the technology has to be bound to yourself. Suddenly, Van doom remembers the second thing Layla told him before they meet which is an imminent attack. He screams to hit the deck for cover.

He also wants to know why Layla did not reach for Trevor help to go back to their past. Layla explains that Trevor does not have a proper handle of his time portals yet that she could have ended in a different time stream. He acquired that knowledge to manage his powers later in his life when he is a criminal. Jaime feels that somebody needs to act to put Trevor in place before he can not hurt people in the future.

However, the people she resurrects are soulless - hallow shells of their former selves, so she does not use this power often on humans, nor does she get any pleasure out of it. Layla does enjoy using her life-giving abilities on animals. The first person she is shown to resurrect is <a href=\"..\/..\/trevor-fitzroy\/29-8300\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Trevor Fitzroy<\/a>, who originally was a good man and lover of <a href=\"..\/..\/ruby-summers\/29-57040\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Ruby Summers<\/a>.

She implants this young version of Layla with a device that give her information about things which present-Layla has already experienced, giving her the 'power' to 'know stuff.' When asked what her powers were she almost always replied that she \"knows stuff.\" This lead to speculation on her power by several sources and the general consensus was that she had the power of precognition.<\/p><p style=\"\">With her \"future history\" she seemed to be able to perceive almost any event's outcome long enough before it occurs to casually (and generally cryptically) warn people if she feels it is warranted.

Several people have demonstrated that they've been 'invisible' to her knowledge of the future. Strong Guy was probably invisible to her powers for a while because he was hypnotized, and Nicole was because the Isolationist built her with a \"chaotic randomizing generator\". In actuality, sometimes she just has 'black spots' in the data download which prevent her from knowing specific details about events. Some beings, with similar knowledge or prediction abilities (like Damian Tryp), can actually cause events that she has seen to not come to pass. However, despite the details, Layla has a considerable knowledge of future.<\/p><p style=\"\">Layla has knowledge of events that will happen, allowing them to evade them.

This artifact grants her with the ability of using an energy beam that produces a sphere force field. This energy force field can be use in a variety of forms.

However, a cat startles her and <a href=\"\/absorbing-man\/4005-1779\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1779\">Absorbing Man<\/a> (who was their target's cousin) grabs her neck and snaps it in half. Absorbing Man then heads for the RV that they were traveling in, to encounter She-Hulk jumping out. The two battle each other across town. She-Hulk is then ambushed by a tiny <a href=\"\/titania\/4005-4943\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4943\">Titania<\/a>, who was shrunken by Hank Pym's particles. Titania invades She-Hulk's ears and begins causing havoc in there. Meanwhile, the Jennifer that got her neck snapped gets up while her neck was still out of joint. She captures their target and heads for She-Hulk. Eventually She-Hulk is able to defeat Absorbing Man and complete their mission.

Unfortunately the Wizard has broken out of his prison and goes to Lyra's dance to kill her. However, on seeing a blast coming from the Wizard, Jake steps in front of it to protect the human Lyra. Seeing her date harmed, Lyra begins to fight the Wizard, however the fight isn't going so well for her and she is almost killed by Bentley when Jennifer shows up. After the Wizard is defeated everyone at the dance blames Lyra, Amelia even lies saying she hadn't known Lyra was a Hulk. Lyra and Jennifer than leave the dance with Lyra saddened because she had hurt her friends.<\/p><h3>Current Events<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4643514-ff2012005dc21.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4643514\" data-ratio=\"1.5192307692308\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4643514-ff2012005dc21.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4643514\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4643514-ff2012005dc21.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4643514-ff2012005dc21.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>She-Hulk in Future Fundation<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Currently Jennifer is serving as one of the replacement members of the Future Foundation or the Fantastic Four in the 4 minute absence of Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben as they travelled 'beyond time and space'.

She has great superhuman strength, endurance, and healing abilities. Unlike the Hulk, she usually retains her intelligence and an ability to transform between Jennifer Walters and She-Hulk.

This ability has been lost at certain points, leaving her either only as Jennifer Walters or only as She-Hulk for extended periods of time.<\/p><p style=\"\">When transforming in and out of She-Hulk form, Jennifer gains and loses mass in the form of body size as well as additional muscle mass. When changing into She-Hulk, her body and hair also take on a distinctly greenish hue. Although the She-Hulk's strength originally remained at a set level and did not increase, later in her history her strength increases as her anger grows, similar to her cousin the Hulk. If she increases her strength level as Jennifer Walters, her strength level as She-Hulk will be vastly greater than it would be otherwise. She has used this to her advantage in the past, using weight training as Jennifer Walters to make her much more powerful than normal as She-Hulk. A side effect of utilizing this facet of her power is that in She-Hulk form her muscle mass increases, making her much larger.<\/p><p style=\"\">As She-Hulk she is able to easily lift more than 100 tons.

She received a degree in criminal law prior to becoming the She-Hulk and is a highly accomplished lawyer.

However, her personality eventually changed throughout the years, and she becomes a more kind and sweet person, while retaining confidence in herself. She wouldn't be too angry during fights, She-Hulk actually jokes around more often now.

The assassination was carried out by HYDRA, specifically a group led by <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/madame-hydra\/4005-3420\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3420\">Madame Hydra<\/a> who threatens to kill all the pursuing policemen forcing Spider-Woman to follow along reluctantly. Viper wants her to rejoin HYDRA, who knows about her mission to hunt Skrulls through her inside connection to SWORD. Arriving at the Hydra base, Jessica tries to kill Viper, but fails as she's protected by a SHIELD force field. Viper brings her to a cell containing another Skrull, not the one she's tasked with finding, but all the same she asks for and gets time alone in the cell with it. The confused Skrull still thinks Jessica is Queen Veranke in disguise and begs her to take him home. Jessica fights it with bare fists and kills it, escaping when Viper opens the door to the cell. Unable to fly, Jessica breaks her fall on a wire and crashes into a fountain. Back in hospital Jessica is taken and questioned again. She turns the tables on the detective by using her fear inducing powers. However, this backfires as the guy is too terrified to tell her anything and crumples to the floor. As the police burst into the room, Jessica pulls on her costume and escapes to the roof, only to be confronted by the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/thunderbolts\/4060-23977\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts<\/a> who want to bring her back to Norman Osborn.

Jessica finds the Skrull's human girlfriend who tells her about the bar where the fake Spider-Man met with his associates. Jessica goes there and provokes Koru Kaviti into breaking cover, revealing himself to be a huge Super-Skrull. As they fight Koru tells her that Queen Veranke picked her to be her disguise because no-one really cared about her enough to notice. As the fight proceeded to go downhill for Jessica (as Koru was a veteran warrior regarded as fourth in command below Veranke), the Avengers arrived to provide assistance. At first, Jessica, in a warrior-rage, thought they were Skrulls too. After coming to her senses, she managed to locate Koru, who had shape-shifted during the chaos. Wolverine then promptly impaled Koru from behind. Jessica was then comforted by Carol Danvers, a long time best friend of hers, and Jessica apologized for isolating herself from everyone.<\/p><h3>New Avengers<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/246473-186342-spider-woman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-246473\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4975\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/246473-186342-spider-woman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-246473\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/246473-186342-spider-woman.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/246473-186342-spider-woman.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spider-Woman, A New Avenger<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">During the Dark Reign of <a href=\"\/norman-osborn\/4005-58812\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn<\/a>'s control of law and order in the US, Jessica was invited by <a href=\"\/wolverine\/4005-1440\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine<\/a> to join the <a href=\"\/new-avengers\/4060-42520\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42520\">New Avengers<\/a>, having nowhere else to go.

She has superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, agility, endurance and durability. As well as possessing the ability to focus the bioelectric energy that her body generates into \"venom blasts\" sufficient to stun or kill normal humans and adhere to almost any surface by excreting an unknown adhesive substance from her palms and soles. Jessica rapidly forms an immunity to all poisons and drugs and is totally immune to radiation. Her body also exudes a high concentration of pheromones which elicit pleasure in most human males while eliciting fear in most females, though she often uses a chemical \"perfume\" that can nullify this effect. She has also demonstrated superhuman senses in her solo series. Jessica has lost and regained her powers more than once, but she has recently emerged with her powers restored greater than ever.<\/p><p style=\"\">In addition to her powers, Jessica is also a superb hand to hand fighter and has trained in several styles of combat, including boxing, judo, karate, and capoeira, which she learned under the training of the Taskmaster. She has also had training in fencing and the use of many other weapons, including most firearms. Jessica was trained by HYDRA and later on by SHIELD in covert operations, stealth, espionage, and information gathering, and she is also a superb athlete. She speaks several foreign languages, including Korean, Russian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and German. Jessica also received vocational training in undercover detective work and sometimes carried a Walther PPK handgun.<\/p><p style=\"\">Whilst not on the same physical level as some of the other Avengers, such as Spider-man, Jessica has shown to be more than capable of using her improved dexterity and reflexes to give more powerful combatants a very difficult time. During her time with S.W.O.R.D, she was locked in a chamber alongside a Skrull Warrior (albeit, it was malnourished and exhausted). She managed to trade blows with it, eventually coming out on top and killing it in the process. Koru Kaviti, the Skrull that originally captured her, on the other hand, was fourth in command below Queen Veranke and near the pinnacle of the Super-Skrull warriors. Jessica, out of costume, traded blows with Koru, holding her own in a losing battle. She took a variety of heavy hits, yet still refused to go down. The fight escalated, smashing through a bar and outside into the city of Madripoor. Whilst the outcome of the fight would most likely have ended in Koru's favor, Jessica held her own until the Avengers arrived, whereupon Koru was impaled by Wolverine.<\/p><h2><b>Alternate Universes<\/b><\/h2><h3>Earth-982 (MC2)<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8632\/571812-spiderman3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-571812\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2346368715084\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8632\/571812-spiderman3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-571812\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8632\/571812-spiderman3.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8632\/571812-spiderman3.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Gerry Drew, son of Jessica Drew, was the third Spider-Man.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In the <a href=\"\/mc2\/4015-43721\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43721\">MC2<\/a> universe, Jessica Drew was never able to regain her powers, which forced her to settle down and eventually get married.

She and her mutant students, the <a href=\"..\/..\/hellions\/65-3199\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hellions<\/a> would encounter the X-Men many times after this. Her time with the Hellfire Club ends when she is attacked by a mad time traveler named <a href=\"..\/..\/trevor-fitzroy\/29-8300\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trevor Fitzroy<\/a>. In the ensuing incident which also involved the X-Men, most of the Hellions are killed, and Emma in sent into a coma. She is eventually revived, although her mind is transferred to Bobby Drake's body. Initially Emma thought Xavier is holding her hostage, so she flees to Frost International - still in <a href=\"..\/..\/iceman\/29-1464\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iceman's<\/a> body. Accessing one of her computers, Emma discovers her Hellions were dead and blames herself for it.<\/p><p style=\"\">When Xavier and some other X-Men finally catch up with her, Frost confesses to Charles that the only reason she fights him over young mutants was that she believes that she could offer them something Xavier can\u2019t, and that their deaths proves that she was wrong. Emma then agrees to go back to the X-Mansion and have her mind transferred back to her body.<\/p><h3>Generation X<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/78357\/1966355-children_present.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/78357\/1966355-children_present.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/78357\/1966355-children_present.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/78357\/1966355-children_present.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Emma forming Generation X<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">While Emma Frost recides in the X-Mansion after her body transfer, she and the rest of the X-Men encounter the evil Phalanx, humans possessed by the transmode virus.

Emma and fellow X-Man Banshee take it upon themselves to find these new mutants before they are captured by the Phalanx. Thus creating an all new team of mutants, which would later become known as Generation X. Emma tries to fight off the Phalanx, but was not strong enough so she combines the powers of Synch and Jubilee. Later, During Generation X's training, Emma's sister Adrienne tries to create chaos at the institute. She plants bombs which are not defused in time, and in a rage Emma shoots and kills her sister. After a while, Emma has visions and is haunted by the past of her sister, but she is able to defeat her once again and expel her from her mind. From that point on she vows not to rely on her telepathic abilities.

The attack wiped out the population of the island. Jean Grey and Hank McCoy traveled to Genosha to help with relief efforts, and discovered only one survivor - Emma Frost. She'd been saved by the manifestation of her secondary mutation, a flexible, organic diamond form. In her arms, she held the corpse of her former student, <a href=\"\/ellie-phimister\/4005-41178\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41178\">Negasonic Teenage Warhead<\/a>, unwilling to accept that she'd died. Emma was taken back to the Xavier Institute so that Beast could run a few tests on her new mutation. He concluded that she'd been gifted with diamond skin. Unfortunately, when in diamond form, Emma discovered that she could no longer access her telepathy. In this form, she could not experience genuine emotion or pain. After telepathically summoning a taxi, Emma planned to leave the Institute, but she said she had an \"epiphany\", and decided to stop the car and head back to the school. She entered as the other X-Men were battling Cassandra Nova. In her diamond form, Emma twisted Nova's neck, killing her, saying that \"There are just some things that shouldn't be forgiven.\" However, Nova had a type of healing factor that kicked in and brought her back. Unbeknownst to the X-Men, Nova had switched places with Xavier by means of a consciousness transfer. Nova now occupied the body of Xavier. As Xavier, she shot her own true body to cripple the real Charles. Cyclops thanks Emma for coming back. Emma plays this off, saying that she'd forgotten her bag, and it was lucky for Scott that it was a Louis Vitton. After this event, Emma decides to join the X-Men.<\/p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Xorn<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8134\/218139-108213-emma-frost.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8134\/218139-108213-emma-frost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8134\/218139-108213-emma-frost.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8134\/218139-108213-emma-frost.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">On a trip to China, the group came upon a captive mutant called Xorn. In an effort to free him, the X-Men battled Chinese militants and John Sublime's U-Men. Eventually, Xorn was free of captivity. Disgusted with the life he knew, he was attempting to overload his powers, which would destroy life on Earth. Emma used her telepathy to psychically \"download\" the Chinese language into Cyclops's mind. Scott was able to talk Xorn down, and even offered him a place on the X-Men.<\/p><p style=\"\">Soon later, Xavier (which was still really Cassandra Nova) outed himself as a mutant on a live talk show. Many reacted to this in a negative way, and soon a large crowd formed outside the school, comprised of protesters, mutant-haters, and the media. Xavier (Nova) decided to visit Charles's lady love, the Empress Lilandra Neramani of the Shi'ar Empire. He left the planet, leaving the team to deal with the new students, the protesters, and Sublime. Jean tried addressing the crowd, but her efforts bore no fruit. Emma, tired of waiting around for Jean's method to work, telepathically brought every member of the crowd to orgasm, simultaneously. They each passed out, and when they woke up, they left in their shame.<\/p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Visiting Sublime<\/h3><p style=\"\">Emma and Scott decided to pay a visit to John Sublime, who'd been preaching to the world that everyone could be a mutant. Despite his seemingly wannabe-attitude, Emma believed he was involved in a plot far more sinister. When questioned by the pair, Sublime had his U-Men attack Emma and Scott. One of them broke Emma's nose. She shifted into diamond form, unable to telepathically shut them down because she was being blocked by the captive <a href=\"\/no-girl\/4005-41121\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41121\">Martha Johansson <\/a>who would go on to become No-Girl. Emma and Scott were detained. The U-Men were given orders to sever Scott's head from his body. They were to later turn their attention to Emma to take her apart and make some sort of human chandelier out of her. While they were occupied with Scott, Emma broke free of her restraints and angrily took down her opponents, freeing Scott in the process. They located Sublime once again in his office. Emma telepathically stimulated the man's pain receptors so that he could feel what she felt when her nose was broken, but amplified to an unbearable degree. Emma then attacked him, slamming him into the large windows, breaking the glass when she did so. She held him several stories above the ground, threatening to drop him. Scott urged her not to, reminding her that X-Men don't kill. Sublime let go of Emma, falling to the his death. Emma told Scott not to blame her as \"he practically somersaulted\" from her grip.<\/p><p style=\"\">Cassandra Nova had been using her influence in the Shi'ar Empire to return to Earth with a host of Shi'ar destroyers. It was revealed that she had unleashed thousands of nano sentinels into the air at the Xavier Institute, infecting the X-Men. She then lied to the Superguardians, telling them that this mutant plague was contagious and needed to be wiped out before it harmed everyone else in the galaxy. The Shi'ar Imperial Guard attacked the Institute. Emma was taken out first so that her formidable telepathic powers would not interfere with their invasion. A device was placed on her head that prevented her from using her powers. As the Superguardians battled their way into the school, Emma was stuck, powerless on the campus. Fortunately for her, the Stepford Cuckoos were able to psychically learn how to unlock the device. They helped Emma out of her constraints, and she headed back to the mansion, where an understanding between the X-Men and the Imperial Guard had been reached. Unfortunately, Cassandra Nova did not halt her attack, still using Xavier's body. All hope seemed lost until Emma returned and tricked Nova into making a deal with her. Emma would provide Nova with a host body if Nova let her live. Nova agreed and entered the body of the alien, Stuff, who was a gelatinous blob programmed for learning basic things, meaning Nova would be trapped in the body of an unintelligent, incompetent alien blob.<\/p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Riot at Xavier's<\/h3><p style=\"\">Later on, <a href=\"\/quentin-quire\/4005-40583\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40583\">Quentin Quire<\/a> aka Kid Omega, the prized pupil of Charles Xavier, and his gang of cronies known as the Omega Gang attacked and inhibited the powers of Professor X. Unable to use his telepathy, the man tried to talk some sense into the students, who'd hooked him up on the wall. They were determined to ruin the school's Open Day the next morning by staging a riot. When crowds of humans arrived to see the wonderful displays the students had created for the school, Quentin made statements about the lies of Xavier and the superiority of mutantkind. <a href=\"\/glob-herman\/4005-40586\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40586\">Glob Herman<\/a> was lit on fire, and he began to hurl balls of flame at the crowds. Emma assumed her diamond form and helped get the humans packed onto buses and away from the dangerous Omega Gang. Quentin had already managed to subdue Wolverine and Professor X. Glob Herman, still aflame, chased the bus of humans, drawing the attention of Beast. Cyclops engaged the Omega Gang, easily taking down several members. A member known as Tattoo phased her hand through Scott's head, threatening to solidify, thereby killing him. Emma slid her diamond hand through Tattoo's own head, saying that if Tattoo solidified, she would die as well. She was able to eliminate <a href=\"\/tattoo\/4005-18499\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18499\">Tattoo<\/a> as a threat. Meanwhile, the Stepford Cuckoos used the powers of their hive mind while Sophie Cuckoo used the drug known as Kick and Cerebra to enhance their powers. Together they were able to subdue Quentin, but at a price. Emma had gone to check on Sophie. She carried the girl's dead body to the outside of the school. The psychic strain had killed Sophie Cuckoo.<\/p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Psychic Affair Outed<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/55540\/2838529-tumblr_mbk9glpzjt1ry3u3oo1_500.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/55540\/2838529-tumblr_mbk9glpzjt1ry3u3oo1_500.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/55540\/2838529-tumblr_mbk9glpzjt1ry3u3oo1_500.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/55540\/2838529-tumblr_mbk9glpzjt1ry3u3oo1_500.png\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">As Jean Grey was returning on a flight back to Westchester from her European missions with new mutant <a href=\"\/dust\/4005-4555\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4555\">Sooraya Qadir<\/a>, aka Dust, the Stepford Cuckoos contacted her, informing her that her husband, Scott, had been having a psychic affair with Emma Frost. The Cuckoos were mad that under Emma's tutelage, Sophie had decided to play the hero and died for it. This was their way of getting revenge. Scott and Emma were in the middle of their psychic tryst when Jean Grey returned, and burst into Emma's thoughts, catching them in the act. Scott tries to explain, but Jean shuts him out, and gets personal with Emma. She forces her way into Emma's mind, and they argue, while Jean explores the depths of Emma's psyche, looking for memories Emma has been keeping well hidden. After invading Emma's mind and stomping around in it, Jean leaves, and Emma falls into Wolverine's arms, admitting finally and lamenting that she has fallen in love with Scott Summers. Beast goes to check on her later on, only to discover, to his shock and dismay, that Emma has been shot and shattered into thousands of little diamond shards. Veteran X-Men Lucas Bishop and Sage arrive on the scene to investigate Emma Frost's murder. They lock down the school and begin questioning everyone. It is later revealed that Angel Salvadore had confronted Emma Frost and shot her in her nose (the flawed weak point of her diamond form), thereby shattering her. Just before this diamond bullet was fired, Emma realized that Esme Cuckoo had been controlling Angel and had forced her to shoot Emma. Hank McCoy busied himself with reassembling Emma's diamond form in his lab, as if it were a giant puzzle. When he was nearing completion, Jean decided to step in and used her Phoenix powers to piece Emma back together and fuse all the shards. Emma was alive again, and the first thing she did was shout out the name of Esme. Bishop and Sage confronted Esme as she was attempting to escape the school. She easily defeated them telepathically, and then left the premises in a cab. It was revealed that Esme had been dealing the drug Kick at the school, and had gotten rid of Emma because she had been investigating it. Sooner or later, she would have discovered that Esme was behind it all. Esme had been using Kick to enhance her telepathy so that she could take total control of the hive mind she shared with the other Stepford Cuckoos. Sophie attempted to fight back, and because of that, Esme influenced Sophie's brash heroism during the riot at the school, thereby steering Sophie to her death. It was not Emma's fault, after all.<\/p><h3>Co-leader of the X-Men<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117763\/2831877-house_of_m__1___page_10.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117763\/2831877-house_of_m__1___page_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117763\/2831877-house_of_m__1___page_10.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117763\/2831877-house_of_m__1___page_10.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">After Jean\u2019s death at the hands of <a href=\"..\/..\/xorn\/29-3183\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xorn<\/a>, Emma makes her romantic relationship with Cyclops public, despite the disapproval of others .

They searched for survivors as they looked upon the carnage that the Marauders and the Purifiers had left in their wake. Emma used her telepathy to scan for survivors. The baby Hope was missing, and the X-Men believed Mr. Sinister's Marauders had taken her. In an effort to find her, a team of five - Wolverine, Storm, Nightcrawler, Colossus, &amp; Angel - was dispatched to confront the Marauders. Sinister, believing that taking down the team would be simple, was surprised to find that there was a sixth X-Man with them: though her body was back at the mansion, Emma was psychically present, shielding the minds of the X-Men against Sinister's telepathy. When the Sentinels that stood guard over the school were hijacked by Bishop (unbeknownst to the team), Emma's concentration was broken, and the team became susceptible to Sinister's attacks. Emma was also with the team later on when they battled the Marauders, and took down Harpoon. During the battle on Muir Island, Emma psychically engaged Exodus, and the two battled telepathically. Though Exodus was capable of other feats (telekinesis, etc.), Emma was able to keep him so completely focused on their psi-battle that he was unable to use his other abilities on her. While Emma kept him distracted, Dust entered his body one grain of sand at a time, and scoured his lungs, incapacitating the mutant, while the rest of the X-Men finished off the remaining Marauders.<\/p><h3>House of M &amp; M Day<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4175743\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4175743-4251507502-house.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.48428571428571\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4175743-4251507502-house.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4175743\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11119\/111191377\/4175743-4251507502-house.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11119\/111191377\/4175743-4251507502-house.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Put her down.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After the reality warp caused by the Scarlet Witch, Emma Frost was married to Scott Summers and the couple had three children. Emma was the first person Wolverine contacted when he discovered that reality had been altered by Wanda. Once \"reawakened\", Emma was able to use her telepathy to restore the memories of others, thereby \"reawakening\" them as well. After a significant number of heroes, both X-Men and Avengers, had their memories restored, a meeting was held to discuss what should be done regarding the Scarlet Witch. Speaking to this issue, Emma said, \"What is their to say? Put her down\". Emma was the only one who agreed with Logan - the Scarlet Witch needed to be killed. A large group of X-Men and Avengers traveled to Genosha to deal with the Scarlet Witch. Wanda was driven to the edge, and in this final moment of madness, she uttered the words \"No more mutants\" deactivating the x-gene of mutants all over the world, thereby significantly decreasing the mutant population from hundreds of thousands to mere hundreds. Emma had been monitoring the battle via Cerebro, and upon the utterance of those words, Emma witnessed thousands of lights representing mutants suddenly go out.

Emma's first fight with the team occurred when she arrests a group of mutant vandals led by her own former student, <a href=\"..\/..\/hellion\/29-40454\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hellion.<\/a> Emma insists on touring a mutant prison to see how the prisoners are being treated. She is then contacted, weakly, by <a href=\"..\/..\/professor-x\/29-1505\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor Xavier<\/a>, and he informs her that he and Hank are being kept prisoner there. He also tells her that the Omega Chair, developed by the <a href=\"..\/..\/dark-beast\/29-3422\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dark Beast<\/a> has horrible side effects, and that Osborn isn't telling her everything. Emma then verbally reassures the Professor that she believes him, and that she would make sure everything would be all right.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/nation-x\/4045-55961\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55961\">Nation X<\/a><\/h3><p style=\"\">In <a href=\"..\/..\/nation-x\/39-55961\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nation X<\/a>, Osborn retreated, leaving the mutants to build their Utopia, Emma continues to support Cyclops, though she was seemingly trapped in her diamond form until the Void essence could be safely removed. To help her, Xavier telepathically links Emma and Cyclops' minds. Cyclops finds himself in a vast white room inside Emma's mind. Many representations of Emma are present, and Emma's main consciousness approached him. Just as they began to discuss how to extract the Void, all the other Emma personalities attacks Cyclops, while the main Emma is pulled into the empty whiteness.<\/p><p style=\"\">She flies away from it towards Cyclops' thoughts until she is able to reach him through a hole he had blasted through the whiteness. Once rescued Emma sees something over Cyclops' shoulder, and is abruptly ejected from her mind and into the real world, no longer in her diamond form.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/necrosha\/4045-55941\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55941\">Necrosha<\/a><\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1079311\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/1079311-x_nercrosha_the_gathering_0012_copy_copia.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.62\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/1079311-x_nercrosha_the_gathering_0012_copy_copia.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1079311\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6754\/1079311-x_nercrosha_the_gathering_0012_copy_copia.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6754\/1079311-x_nercrosha_the_gathering_0012_copy_copia.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Selene looking for Emma<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In <a href=\"\/necrosha\/4045-55941\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55941\">Necrosha<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/selene\/29-2176\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Selene<\/a> recently resurrected Emma's Hellions are sent to attack her.

She later leaves this post to fight with the other X-Men on the Golden Gate Bridge. She acted very nervous when Hope manifested the Phoenix Force, but she was told by Wolverine that there is nothing she can do now. She acts cold and unconcerned towards Scott when he seeks her out for moral support due to being in this form. She then sees the Phoenix Force manifest around <a href=\"..\/..\/hope-summers\/29-49329\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hope<\/a> and remembers <a href=\"..\/..\/jean-grey\/29-3552\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jean Grey's<\/a> words to her when she saw her during the Sisterhood attack: \"Prepare\".<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/fear-itself\/4045-56288\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56288\">Fear Itself<\/a><\/h3><p style=\"\">Emma and the other X-Men are forced to protect the city of San Francisco from Kuurth, Unstoppable Juggernaut. After creating a psychic conference room for the mayor, Cyclops, and herself; Emma waits on Cerebro to attack the Juggernaut mentally when the team can get his helmet off. Once his helmet is off, Emma tries to attack telepathically but suffers extreme psychic distress. She is sent to the recovery center on Utopia alongside Hope Summers, who, in a moment of confusion, she tries to suffocate. She is stopped by Namor who she mistakes for Cyclops and kisses him by accident, only to snap back to her senses and shoo him away telling him to never tell Scott about this. Namor continues to tell Emma that Scott is undeserving of her love, and that he would make a far more suitable partner.<\/p><h3>Curse of the Mutants<\/h3><p style=\"\">Emma was present when Xarus's united vampire nation attacked various parts of San Francisco. Jubilee was targeted by a vampire suicide bomber, and was thusly transformed into a vampire, herself. The plan was to lure Logan aka Wolverine out to track her down and save her. According to Scott's plan, Logan's healing factor was temporarily negated and he turned into a vampire as well. Emma suggested finding the deceased Dracula, and reanimating him so that he might take down Xarus for them. Namor retrieved Dracula's head and Storm and Gambit were dispatched to find the body. Once put back together, Dracula threatened to simply attack Utopia himself. Eventually, Xarus led a full-scale attack on Utopia, which was defended by the \"Tough Skin\" squad, led by Cyclops, Emma, and Blade, the vampire hunter. Assuming her diamond form, Emma was able to effectively battle the vampire hordes because they could not bite her or do any damage. The sheer numbers of Xarus's legion soon overwhelmed the X-Men, and as they prepared to fall back, the vampire Wolverine was sent to kill Scott. It was then that Scott's plan played out, as Logan's healing factor was restored, and he returned to normalcy. Dracula's arrival saw Emma's plan play out, as father killed son, and the X-Men were able to send the vampires back to where they came from, relatively unscathed.<\/p><h3>Schism<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4275486-3529923994-19345.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4275486\" data-ratio=\"0.47218788627936\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:47.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4275486-3529923994-19345.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4275486\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11119\/111191377\/4275486-3529923994-19345.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11119\/111191377\/4275486-3529923994-19345.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Emma &amp; Quentin<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">When Scott Summers and Wolverine visited the United Nations to speak at an International Arms Control Conference, they were surprised to find another mutant in attendance: <a href=\"\/quentin-quire\/4005-40583\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40583\">Quentin Quire<\/a>, aka Kid Omega. Quentin used his vast psychic powers to force the world leaders in the room to reveal their deepest darkest secrets on live television. This incident sparked worldwide outrage and widespread panic. Mutant hysteria was at an all time high as world leaders took old models of Sentinels that had been commissioned long ago out of storage. The Sentinels in nearly every country had been reactivated, and were on the lookout for mutants. Emma Frost broadcast a telepathic message to every remaining mutant on the planet, warning them about the sentinels, and urging them to lay low. Emma also ran telepathic surveillance with the Stepford Cuckoos as teams were deployed into the field to destroy the sentinels. The old models began to malfunction and began attacking everyone around them - not just humans. Soon thereafter, Quentin Quire turned up on Utopia seeking sanctuary. Wolverine decided against it, but Cyclops allowed him to stay. He was sent to a room, but not without a stern warning from Emma. While most X-Men were out dealing with the sentinel problem, Emma decided to visit the Museum of Mutant History located elsewhere in San Francisco on the night of its grand opening. The mutant-friendly Mayor Sinclair had invited Cyclops to the event. Cyclops decided to send the <a href=\"\/namor\/4005-1476\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Sub-Mariner<\/a>, <a href=\"\/colossus\/4005-1460\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus<\/a>, <a href=\"\/iceman\/4005-1464\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/magneto\/4005-1441\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto <\/a>with Emma as a show of force to the outside world. While at the museum, Emma notes that she is mentioned barely four times, and in three of them, as a villain. Later, after taking photos, Emma and the X-Men are attacked by Kade Kilgore, his Inner Circle, and their henchmen. Emma's telepathy is blocked by a device activated by <a href=\"\/maximilian-von-katzenelnbogen\/4005-80676\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80676\">Maximilian Frankenstein<\/a> of Kilgore's Inner Circle. He reveals there is a tiny button hidden away in his glove by his pinkie finger that allowed him to block her powers. Emma simply breaks his finger, reactivating her telepathic powers. Before she has the ability to shut down the invaders, a space slug is attached to her face, incapacitating Emma and the others. With the 'heavy hitters' down, Idie Okonkwo aka <a href=\"\/oya\/4005-73388\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73388\">Oya<\/a>, decides, based on Cyclops's orders, to attack the intruders. She burns them alive, all except for Kilgore and his Inner Circle, who escape. This attack sets Wolverine off against Cyclops, saying that it wasn't right for Oya to do what she did. Wolverine blamed Scott, and Scott accepted the blame. By the time the slug was removed from Emma's face, Cyclops and Wolverine had taken down a mega-sentinel that attacked Utopia - with the help of the mutant children.<\/p><p style=\"\">This final battle was what made up Logan's mind. He decided to leave Utopia saying that Cyclops was turning children into soldiers. Scott and Logan invited the rest of the mutants to make up their mind, and choose a side, and reassured them that there would be no hard feelings. Cyclops naturally assumed that Emma would stay on Utopia with him. Emma told him he shouldn't have assumed as much. She revealed that he has forced her to sacrifice everything she believes in, everything she loves to be with him on Utopia. She believed in teaching the next generation, not in fighting. After explaining why she <em>should<\/em> leave, Emma reveals that she liquidated her company in order to bankroll Utopia, since Angel would be leaving. She did it even before Scott asked if she would be staying, showing that she'd already resolved to remain with him.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/regenesis\/4045-56644\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56644\">Regenesis<\/a><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4275488-2563118455-X-men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4275488\" data-ratio=\"1.5165876777251\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4275488-2563118455-X-men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4275488\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11119\/111191377\/4275488-2563118455-X-men.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11119\/111191377\/4275488-2563118455-X-men.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Choosing a Side<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Emma stays with Scott on Utopia where she liquidates her company in order to bankroll Utopia for the time being.

Emma and the team fought the Sinister people until Mr. Sinister invites them into to his domain. Sinister telepathically controlls the team, but due to being in her diamond form Emma is immune but surrounded. Emma told Hope a code word that replicates Emma's diamond form to protect Hope from Sinister prior to entering his domain. With Sinister shot through the head by Hope thanks to Emma, the team is freed from his telepathic control but Sinister predicts this would happen and the team learns Sinister's copies have become a hive-mind like species.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emma and the team continue to battle the Sinister Species when Emma realizes that Sinister is using Cyclop's mind as a blueprint for his species. Emma has Namor hold her left arm as a tourniquet and abandons her diamond form where she successfully uses her telepathy to mind blast the Sinisters.

Emma is about to be told to leave by Scott but cuts him short refusing to go. The team stares the Celestials down vowing to protect the Dreaming Celestial and Earth. A group of people gather looking at the X-men but they do nothing, no throwing things, no derogatory slurs. They only show fear which was Cyclops' initial plan all along. Emma's diamond arm was eventually reattached by a molecular weaving machine made by <a href=\"\/x-club\/4060-56306\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56306\">X-Club<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emma was seen training, getting back into to fighting condition after her arm reattachment.

Unit uses a fake double mind, which is what he used in the first place to make a false mutant detection signal in order to draw out Hope, allowing him the chance to shoot a small laser at Emma stunning her. He then uses a pheromone barrage on her and Namor forcing them to become intimate on the battlefield which makes Scott angry and jealous causing him to blast Unit. With Unit's eventual defeat at the hands of Danger, the team returns home where Emma apologizes to Scott about what happened with her and Namor. He tells her that he was alright with what happened since she was forced to do so and had no choice in the matter.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/avengers-vs-x-men\/4045-56674\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56674\">Avengers vs. X-Men<\/a><\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2389208\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117763\/2389208-avengers_vs_x_men_005__282012_29__28digital_29__28zone_empire___29___page_23.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.4406991260924\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.1%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117763\/2389208-avengers_vs_x_men_005__282012_29__28digital_29__28zone_empire___29___page_23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2389208\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/117763\/2389208-avengers_vs_x_men_005__282012_29__28digital_29__28zone_empire___29___page_23.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/117763\/2389208-avengers_vs_x_men_005__282012_29__28digital_29__28zone_empire___29___page_23.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Phoenix Five<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Emma sides with the X-Men where she tried to take Hope deeper into Utopia away from the Avengers and the battle. She was close to telepathically shutting down the the Avenger's mental defenses when Iron Man shows up using a nanotech taser cloud to block her telepathy. Emma is forced into her diamond form and after a brief battle with Iron Man is defeated shortly after until Magneto shows up to battle Iron Man, saving her. After the Avengers have soundly won the Battle of Utopia and Hope has run off, Cyclops surrenders the X-Men. The Avengers become aware that this is just a ruse, as Cyclops has Magik teleport the X-Men away. Emma is with Scott when he visits the Jean Grey School to ask for recruits and sanctuary. A brief battle with Wolverine's X-Men ensues, and the Extinction Team leaves the premises. They find out Hope is heading to the moon. Emma, and four other mutants, Cyclops, Magik, Colossus,and Namor, acquire a shard of the Phoenix thanks to Iron Man using a new armor to stop it from bonding with Hope. Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five take Hope back to Earth in order to prepare for future events. They announce they will cleanse the Earth.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emma and the rest of the <a href=\"\/phoenix-five\/4060-59234\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59234\">Phoenix Five<\/a> fix the Earth by ending hunger, providing an unlimited source of free, clean energy and water, and also outlaw war 'Pax Utopia'. In order to outlaw war, they destroy all large weapons including sentinels, missiles, submarines, tanks, etc. Emma destroyed sentinels from all around the world. In order to complete this job, she arrived at Avengers Academy to destroy the sentinel belonging to <a href=\"\/juston-seyfert\/4005-41669\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41669\">Juston<\/a>. Despite its being a killing machine, Juston has grown attached to the sentinel and refuses to let Emma destroy it. The students of the Academy step in to prevent Emma from taking the sentinel apart. Hank Pym joins the fray, and together they make a stand against Emma, who easily tosses them around with her new powers. She cannot understand why the students would want to protect a mutant-hunting robot. She is most surprised by X-23 who attacks Emma to defend her friend. Laura is a mutant and Emma believed that she would side with her. Emma was able to thwart Laura's attack by shifting into diamond form. Emma offered to simply wipe the processing unit of the sentinel, so that its prime directive to \"Destroy all mutants!\" would be erased. Juston wouldn't allow this claiming that it would do away with the sentinel's personality. Having been unable to reach a compromise, Emma decided to simply destroy the machine. Rather than melting it however, she took it apart, so that Juston could rebuild it with a new unit. She melted its core so that it could not be used again. After extending an invitation to X-23 (that was hastily rejected), Emma took her leave of the school. Unbeknownst to her, Quicksilver had switched out the sentinel's unit with his super speed so that the sentinel would be safe after all. Emma's battle at Avengers Academy led to Hank Pym's announcement that the school would be closed because it was unsafe.<\/p><p style=\"\">Later, Emma and Namor talk about <a href=\"\/transonic\/4005-72484\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72484\">Transonic<\/a> being imprisoned. Namor is disgusted with it and Emma tells him she knows where the girl is. In what appears to be a manipulative moment for Emma, most likely due to the corruption and the power of the part of the Phoenix Force in her, kisses Namor and tells him Transonic is in Wakanda and that she, Emma, hasn't told Scott about her whereabouts.Another scuffle with the Avengers occurs when the Avengers invade a remodeled Utopia (which now ascends all the way into the sky with all new levels of paradise) to snatch away Hope Summers. Emma and Scott prepare to battle the Avengers and permanently end the conflict, but the Scarlet Witch intervenes and teleports a voluntary Hope and the Avengers away. Emma talks with Cyclops who goes on to say that despite all the good X-Men do and all the good they have done, mankind still hates and fears them. That they will always be pushed further into a corner and steal away their innocent despite being endangered so few. The humans will always send their \"heroes\" to attack the mutants and continue to push them around. She watches as Cyclops simply states \"No more Avengers.\" He plans to take the Avengers off the board, permanently.<\/p><p style=\"\">With Magneto bringing Namor's actions to Scott's attention, he questions Emma. Emma tells him Namor is his own man and that Scott has no authority over him. Emma tells him to look at the benefit of what happened with the Avengers being found. Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five go to Wakanda where in Namor's defeat, they absorb his share of the Phoenix Force. Emma calls for a meeting with Scott in the remote location of the Danakil Desert in Ethiopia. Emma and him talk and she goes on to say she has reached into every mind on Earth. Scott tells her that she needs to stop sounding like Namor and that this isn't a war and she needs to come home. Emma tells Scott that Hope is in <a href=\"\/kun-lun\/4020-56104\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56104\">K'un Lun.<\/a> Scott rushes off to retrieve Hope leaving Emma in mid-sentence begging for him to stop her as she is scared for what she might do next as the Phoenix Force's influence corrupts her further. She ends up making a man who had a hit and run accident with a thirteen year old mutant boy years ago and never reported it just because he was a mutant, brain dead. When Colossus and Magik fight, they manage to knock each other out in an attempt to gain the other's portion of the Phoenix Force. They are returned to their normal forms as their portions of the Phoenix Force leave them and presumably go to Emma and Scott.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emma is now almost completely corrupted by the Phoenix Force. She has forced all the remaining X-Men to bow down and worship her. Only one resisted and that was Magneto. Emma explains that she is indeed the more powerful of the two which spites Magneto to contact Xavier saying both Emma and Scott are completely gone. Scott is in need of more power after his defeat at the hands of Hope taking the power of Iron Fist and Scarlet witch so he is heading after Emma.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emma talks with Scott telling him she can read his thoughts about how he thinks he might take her half. Emma begins to go on on a rant threatening to burn the world but Cyclops yells at her to stop talking like that and asks what has gotten into her. She replies with a worried look that she doesn't know. The Avengers and X-Men attack the two remaining avatars and they fight back. As the fight continues on the outside, Emma and Cyclops have a psychic dinner discussing things. Emma reveals to Scott even more disturbing tendencies such as using human blood as a sauce for a steak. She tells him about the psychic affair and that she truly loves him. She continues to talk about destroying the world and that she will be a queen of ash and they will just rebuild anew. Emma's corruption is almost complete and Cyclops realizes this. He asks for her forgiveness as Emma is stricken down by him and her half of the force is absorbed. Emma is arrested by the Avengers whom are then attacked by Purifers being labeled as mutant sympathizers. The Avengers defeat them and then Emma is escorted to prison and the Extinction team is revealed to still be active.<\/p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Consequences<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2665586\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85507\/2665586-poly.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.51340996168582\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85507\/2665586-poly.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2665586\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/85507\/2665586-poly.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/85507\/2665586-poly.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Never without heels<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Kitty sees Emma in prison, asking her if she wants Emma to take a message to Scott.

Emma is furious at Scott for all his actions and betrayal and Cyclops tells her it wasn't him and it was the Phoenix. Emma storms off and Cyclops tells her to read his mind to show her how sorry he really is but Emma reveals she cannot as the Phoenix altered their powers and her telepathy is gone. Emma also tells Scott they best not be near each other and when she was seemingly going to end the relationship right then and there, the cops start heading towards them as Magik teleports the group away. In Australia, a new mutant girl named <a href=\"\/eva\/4005-86432\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86432\">Eva<\/a> has just awakened her powers after her over protective brother started a fight. The girl formed a time sphere around a block in Australia with the Police and Federal Guard outside the sphere. Emma tells the mutant girl that these are the scariest times in mutant lives. The team offers to help her learn to control her powers if she will join them. When the temporal sphere goes down, Emma shifts into her diamond form, and along with Magneto and Cyclops, she helps protect Eva and fight off the police forces.<\/p><p style=\"\">With Cyclops and Magneto discussing the issues at hand in a field, Emma tells them both a new mutant has been revealed. When Magik teleports Cyclops and Magneto back to the <a href=\"\/weapon-x\/4060-5018\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5018\">Weapon X<\/a> facility, Cyclops storms and Emma asks what happened where Magneto tells her that the Original Five X-Men have been brought to the present. Magneto mentions young Cyclops and Jean Grey which is all Emma needed to hear as she goes to find Cyclops. She finds him on a hill where she starts to ask him what happened. While reluctant, Cyclops tells her that they were all real. Emma ponders who would have the technology and wherewithal to something like this. With Cyclops pointing out Beast would be the only one, Emma figures it makes sense since Cyclops killed Xavier that with Hank not being able to kill Scott would punish him instead. She shows up with Scott and the group to the Jean Grey institute to deliver his explanation of what happened in Avengers vs X-Men to clear the air and offer the new students to join his side of things at the new Xavier institute.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\">Emma recently took Jean Grey to <a href=\"\/madripoor\/4020-42665\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42665\">Madripoor<\/a> after promising to train her in her psionic powers.

Fabio is being detained by the police at the time for his powers awakening and causing a comotion. The X-Men manage to stop the police but are soon attacked by a group of sentinels. The veteran X-Men manage to defeat the sentinels, even with their altered powers with Cyclops delivering the final blow, leveling the entire area as the group stare in amazement at his power.

She has a deep conversation with Scott about their current situation. While they agree they are separated, they show they still care about each other and will continue to work with each other for the betterment of the students. They head inside the new school and go over the current mutant situation. The team teleports to Australia to visit Eva Bell's mother, and not long after showing up, the X-Men and recruits are intercepted by an Avengers squad.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emma and Scott stand up to the Avengers with the bold proclamation that the Avengers are the ones responsible for the death of Charles Xavier. After some statements from Cyclops and the Avengers almost assaulting the X team, Eva Bell freezes them in a temporal bubble. Cyclops makes the statement that the X-Men will protect all the mutants and humans that support them and that a warning to the people who will deny them their freedom has been issued. The X team is transported back to the New Xavier Institute where Magneto is revealed to be the mole. The team shows disgust at the reveal except for Emma, who realizes that Magneto being a double agent is an ingenious plan and even convinces Scott it can play to their advantage.

The Cuckoos psychically torture Emma to a degree about it and uncover what happened between her and Scott. Emma doesn't blame them for their actions as she does understand they are just like her. Emma and the Cuckoos then have a psychic conversation about the events happening at the school with the original X-Men coming to the future. The Cuckoos do make mention of Jean Grey and that she is still very untrained, as they have been reading her mind quite frequently. Emma tells the Cuckoos to come with her to the Xavier School where she will continue to train them. Emma and group leave for a period to return to their school and find the new mutants getting attacked by the Danger Room. It is then that Magik's powers show her broken state as she screams out in pain, briefly disappears, and reappears in a small burst of flames. Emma and the veteran X-Men leave once more for the Jean Grey school and upon their return, the Cuckoos have come to the the new Xavier Institute along with the younger version of Angel.<\/p><p style=\"\">After Magik's powers go off again, Cyclops has a talk with her and brings her back.

Emma transforms into diamond form to keep herself protected and when Dormammu commands his mindless ones to attack the team, Emma gets the Stepford Cuckoos to turn the fearful new mutant's mindsets into bravery, thus giving them to courage to fight back. Emma and the rest of the team fight the minions to save themselves and Magik.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emma continues battling the mindless ones and the group is soon getting overwhelmed with some getting injured. Magik manages to free herself and cast everyone out while absorbing the entire dimension into herself. One of the students, Benjamin, is nearly dead, but Emma coaches Christopher through the use of his ability and save him. Scott apologizes to the team and tells them they all must train. Emma and Scott escort Fabio home, as he could not handle the pressure that comes with being an X-man. Emma tells the team not to worry as new mutants are popping up all over the world, and the team rescues and recruits a new mutant by the name of David Bond, who has the ability to control cars. Emma is seen coaching David when he is controlling a massive plane just outside of the compound. When Irma of the Stepford Cuckoos dyes her hair, Emma is seen escorting her back inside when Celeste freaks out on her. Emma helps the team invade the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier when they catch word of Fabio being kidnapped and interrogated and the team manages to successfully save Fabio.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emma and Scott are training the students, but the former couple end up having a small argument. After watching Eva perform a new ability with her powers, Emma and the rest of the X-Men end up watching a pro-mutant rally in honor of Scott. The X-Men go and join the rally where Emma watches Scott give a speech, but not long after a new sentinel attacks them.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Blockbuster sentinel attacks, and appears to vaporize him. Much to worry of Emma, but due to a timely save from Magik, he is alright. Emma goes diamond and charges the machine, only to be knocked back and caught by Angel. The rest of the X-Men try their luck at attacking it, but the sentinel keeps adapting. Eventually, Magneto arrives and does a final attack. The sentinel appears to ready to explode, and with Cyclops demanding the robot tell him who sent it, Emma saves Scott before it does leave an explosion, but only due to the assailant calling it back.<\/p><p style=\"\">During a training session, Emma watches as Cyclops is being especially hard on Benjamin for giving up in a training exercise. When Benjamin gets out of the shower, Emma is clad in different clothes and begins to get close to the student in an attempt to make him uncomfortable and push him to get his powers to activate. The attempt works as Emma picks up on his traits and comes to the conclusion that he is more than just a shape-shifter, and that he can mess with technology, and that he releases a pheromone of sorts that makes people feel good about themselves. Emma and Magik take him to Atlanta, Georgia where they put his powers to the test. Emma ends up having the student run an actual mission. She hands him a letter and tells Benjamin to bring it all the way up to <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/dum-dum-dugan\/4005-3526\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3526\">Timothy Dugan<\/a>'s office with a note telling him that in someone inside SHIELD is attacking mutants.

Emma and everyone are attacked by a large sentinel and their powers begin to shut off. Emma manages to help get the students behind Cyclops and Magik saves the day with a spell. Emma and the group head back to the institute and come to the conclusion that whoever is baiting them is using cerebro and sending out false signals to lure them in. They unplug cerebro and they come to the conclusion that only a few people know to use cerebro: Xavier who is dead, Magneto, who wouldn't do this, and Beast. Cyclops and Magik head to the Xavier institute and leave Emma behind with the students. Emma is later seen with the students knowing that something wrong is happening and that she is worried about Scott. Emma is with the students when Magneto shows up with Dazzler. He has Triage heal her. Emma and the crew are about to leave when Magik arrives and teleports them to the Jean Grey school to see what is happening. They look on as Sentinels and helicarriers are attacking, but Hijack returns and saves the day. Scott reveals to everyone that it was Dark Beast who attacked them, but what happened was on Maria Hill's watch.<\/p><h3>Battle of the Atom<\/h3><p style=\"\">Emma Frost and the rest of the Uncanny X-Men arrive on the scene of a battle to team up with Kitty Pryde and her students consisting of the remaining Original Five X-Men. After the destruction of all the sentinels, one of the heads remains active and kills the younger Cyclops, causing the older one to disappear and cease to exist. Emma gets Christopher to revive the younger Scott Summers, and the older one returns back to reality. After the battle, the Uncanny X-Men leave and return to their school where they watch the footage of their fight for studying. Emma ends up having a telepathic battle with the older Jean Grey from the future by being a conduit for the Stepford Cuckoos' telepathy, but Emma is ultimately defeated. More and more X-Men from the future continue to come to the present. Emma, along with the rest of the X-Men, continue to battle the designated evil future team. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s anti-mutant weapon armament is completely activated, and the X-Men work together to finish the battle while they manage to stop the assault, but not without some casualties.<\/p><h3>Original Sin<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4171586\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4171586-6485970619-spin1.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.88571428571429\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4171586-6485970619-spin1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4171586\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11119\/111191377\/4171586-6485970619-spin1.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11119\/111191377\/4171586-6485970619-spin1.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Emma and Ant-Man: joining the team! <\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Emma Frost was recruited by a mysterious boss during the events of Original Sin to join a team of three that included Ant-Man and the Black Panther. Other teams of two or three were also being formed, and each group led a mini investigation of the death of Uatu the Watcher. Their investigations would eventually lead all the involved parties to a supposedly secret space station, in which all the teams argued with each other and tried to answer some of their questions. Who had led them there? Who were they working for? And why? Fighting broke out as an enraged Gamora threatened the Winter Soldier who appeared to have murdered Nick Fury. Emma Frost came to his defense, shifting into diamond form, and smashing her fist into Gamora, who returned the blow in kind. Eventually, things cleared up. The Nick Fury that Bucky had \"killed\" was actually a Life Model Decoy. The real Nick Fury revealed himself to the teams as the mysterious boss that they had been working for. He explained his story to them - that he was the \"man on the wall\" doing terrible things to defend Earth. He had selected each of them and led them to the space station so that he might choose one of them to become his successor. He believed they each possessed a special and lethal set of skills that would make them right for the job. The Avengers back on Earth soon caught on, and made their way to the space station to investigate. A battle between the Avengers, Fury, and Fury's possible successors ensued. When all was cleared up, and Fury was presumed dead, the heroes, including Emma returned to Earth ... except for Thor, who because of something Fury whispered to him, was unworthy of his hammer, and could no longer lift it.<\/p><h3>The Last Will and Testament of Charles Xavier<\/h3><p style=\"\">Emma is seen with Dazzler, Magneto, and Magik at Mystique's old hideout in search of her. They find nothing and head back to the New Xavier School. Emma talks with Scott that he needs to apologize to David for kicking him off the team. Later on, the Jean Grey Institute Staff arrive at Scott's school and tell him that he needs to come with them about Xavier's will. Emma volunteers to go in Scott's place, but they all head to the JGS, and there She-Hulk begins reading the will and announces that Xavier was married to Mystique. Emma ends up being the only one to laugh at the new found revelation. Emma sat and listened with most of the Will as Xavier explained how he was forced to psychically and slowly, lobotomize a young mutant by the name of <a href=\"\/matthew-malloy\/4005-105952\" data-ref-id=\"4005-105952\">Matthew Malloy<\/a>, since Xavier could not help him and his powers were too strong to control. After Xavier mentions that this goes against everything he taught the X-Men that no mutant should ever be left behind, but he did to this one, only periodically reinforcing the psychic blocks he built in the child over the years. With Xavier telling them that the rest of the will is to be played after Cyclops and Wolverine, along with Rachel Grey, reinforce the mental blocks on Matthew, Cyclops has an outburst in anger. While he refuses to help Xavier due to being lied to, Emma is the only one who seems to get through to him, and thus, he leaves for Xavier's final request with Emma staying behind at the Jean Grey Institute.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emma is with Kitty and Dazzler when Beast walks in with the rest of the JGS staff to warn them that no one is going to help them, but that SHIELD is planning on attacking and killing Malloy, whom Cyclops is with. Beast gets an update that Scott was killed during an attack on Malloy. Upon hearing this, Emma storms out of the Jean Grey School and onto the lawn, and in her grief, causes a massive psychic projection that harms the staff and students of the school along with the Cuckoos back at the New Xavier School. Matthew Malloy appears on the front lawn in front of her, and Emma asks if he was there with Scott. After he replies yes, Emma punches him, and in reflex Malloy accidentally kills her.<\/p><p style=\"\">After Eva goes back in time to find a younger Xavier, she tells him what is going on, and they fix it by making sure Malloy's parents never conceive Matthew and Eva returns back to her timeline, which has then prevented any of the teachers from dying. The will is finished and Scott inherits the Jean Grey School, but he signs it over to Storm and asks for her to take in his students, and all Emma says is Scott just shut down the school.<\/p><p style=\"\">After the events of the Last Will and Testament of <a href=\"\/professor-x\/4005-1505\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Charles Xavier,<\/a> Scott has shut down his school and transferred the students to the Jean Grey Institute. Emma questions Scott about the revolution and what it truly meant. She suggests they start all over. Scott shoots her down, but Emma reveals her powers have returned and that he is conflicted about her and that she is to him as well.

Her psionic powers allow her to perform several feats such as mental communication, mind reading, mind control, induce paralysis, possession, hypnosis, pain stimulation, illusion casting, astral projection, psychic surgery, and by collecting ambient psionic energy she can create powerful psionic lightning bolts or \"psi-bolts\", that can attack on a physical or mental level and are capable of rendering a person unconscious or even killing them. Emma's telepathy is powerful enough to communicate and effect people all the way across the planet. She has even done a mental broadcasting of Cyclops' own thoughts to all of the remaining mutants that were left on the Earth. Emma has also displayed psychometric powers, having taught a class of young mutants how to do so, as well. Using her telepathy, she can also psionically shut off another's mutant's telepathy.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emma has been stated to be an \"Omega Class Telepath\" (the same classification as Charles Xavier), a level 10 psi and one of the top five telepaths on Earth. Emma's telepathy manifested itself in her teens, and she has devoted her life to mastering her many psychic skills. For a period following the death of Jean Grey and the de-powering of Professor Xavier (though he has since regained his abilities), Emma has acted as the X-Men's primary telepath.<\/p><p style=\"\">After utilizing and losing the Phoenix Force post Avengers vs X-Men, Emma's powers have been altered with her losing most of her telepathy as result. Another side effect from the Phoenix Force altering her powers, Emma now projects her thoughts unto people at random intervals with no control over this change.<\/p><p style=\"\">Despite the initial loss of her telepathy, for awhile Emma only had a modicum of her previous power levels. Emma is still one of the most skilled telepaths on Marvel Earth. In place of her shattered telepathy, she was relying upon on the powers of other telepaths to which she uses her own mind as a conduit for, such as the Stepford Cuckoos' or the young Jean Grey's telepathic powers. This enables her to engage within telepathic battles and make full use of her skill since the younger mutants do not possess the knowledge she does. Emma recently revealed that her broken telepathic powers have been repaired and back at her normal levels due to training with the Stepford Cuckoos.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4> <\/h4><h4><b>Organic Diamond Form<\/b><\/h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-79624\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/40\/79624-149754-emma-frost.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/40\/79624-149754-emma-frost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-79624\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/40\/79624-149754-emma-frost.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/40\/79624-149754-emma-frost.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Diamond Form<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Emma gained a secondary mutation during the destruction of <a href=\"\/genosha\/4020-40967\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genosha<\/a>, which manifested as complete transmutation of her organic tissues into a diamond-like substance. It was later revealed in a flashback that <a href=\"\/cassandra-nova\/4005-11317\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11317\">Cassandra Nova<\/a> possibly catalyzed Emma's secondary mutation in order to allow her to survive the harsh environment of Genosha (however, it is still questionable if this is really true). This ability allows Emma to turn into an un-living yet sentient and mobile diamond form, granting her extreme resistance to damage, invulnerability to cold and heat, enhanced speed, super strength (no limit has been clearly defined but handbooks say approximately 2 tons), immortality, and limitless stamina as her body does not tire or produce any fatigue toxins while in this form. She also does not feel pain or emotions and has no need to eat, sleep, or drink while in diamond form. A drawback of her diamond form is she can not access her telepathy, but in return it grants her telepathic immunity to all but a few telepaths. Emma can stay transformed for as long as she likes, and the speed it takes for her to transform in and out of her diamond form is almost instantaneous, being described as happening within a hundredth of a second.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emma's diamond form has stood up to Cyclops' optic blasts, jet crashes, blasts from Bishop, hits from World War <a href=\"\/hulk\/4005-2267\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk<\/a>, the collapse of Genosha, and even a blast from the <a href=\"\/dreaming-celestial\/4005-22836\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22836\">Dreaming Celestial<\/a>'s head when it was taken over by Mr. Sinister. Emma can be broken if hit with the appropriate amount of force, appropriate weapon and her shatter point (believed to be her nose). Her first instance of entirely shattering was due to a diamond bullet hitting her in her shatter point at extremely high speeds. In her second instance of breaking (this did not involve her shatter point), Emma's arm was cut off when attacked by one of the Dreaming Celestial's \"mini celestial\" probes its body broke into. Despite her arm breaking off, this shows an impressive upper limit to the kind of damage her diamond form can take, considering one of them was able to blast a massive gouge in Colossus' chest and send him flying across San Francisco.<\/p><h3> <\/h3><h3>Former Powers<\/h3><h4> <\/h4><h4>Phoenix Force<\/h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2418950\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5648\/2418950-avengers_ac_33c.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.265873015873\" data-width=\"252\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 252px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:126.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5648\/2418950-avengers_ac_33c.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2418950\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5648\/2418950-avengers_ac_33c.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5648\/2418950-avengers_ac_33c.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">While in possession of part of the Phoenix Force, Emma acquires new powers on top of her old ones. She gains the ability to manipulate the Phoenix' cosmic energy for various purposes such as <strong>setting enemies on fire<\/strong> or simply projecting it as <strong>energy blasts<\/strong>. She also gains <strong>telekinetic<\/strong> capabilities and the ability to <strong>fly<\/strong>. Her <strong>telepathy<\/strong> has grown in strength as she was capable of reaching into every mind on Earth. She gains a massive strength boost easily putting her in class 100+ as she was able to fight and defeat a Mjolnir wielding Thor without much difficulty using nothing but physical combat. In her diamond form she becomes almost completely invulnerable as X-23's adamantium claws could not cut her.<\/p><p style=\"\">Perhaps Emma's most unique ability gained from the Phoenix is when Thor \"shattered\" her, (it is possible Emma feigned Thor actually shattering her considering she was playing with him the entire fight) she had conscious control over all the fragments and rained them down through him and then reformed herself, showing Emma in her diamond form combined with the Phoenix Force is possibly unkillable. Despite her now found powers, Emma is not without weakness. Special Shi'ar weaponry, the Iron Fist energy from K'un-Lun and the Scarlet Witch's chaos magic have all been shown to harm them. However, as the Avatars gained more power when one falls, the Scarlet Witch's magic has grown to be less and less effective. As she gained more and more power, the Phoenix's corrupting influence over Emma grew stronger and stronger.<\/p><h3><b><u>Abilities<\/u><\/b><\/h3><h4>Gifted Intellect<\/h4><p style=\"\">Emma is extremely intelligent and cunning, allowing her to traverse the ranks of business, the Hellfire Club, and the X-Men, as well as acquire a great deal of wealth. Her persuasive manner and abilities can easily sway others to do anything in her favor, especially when this skill is backed up with her telepathy.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emma has also spent a great deal of time mentoring young mutants, granting her tremendous knowledge in mutant powers and how they work. When she possessed Iceman's body, she was able to use his powers in ways he had never been capable of before. Emma was the one that discovered Cyclops' inability to control his optic blasts was actually the result of mental blocks that Scott imposed on himself at a young age (and not physical brain damage, as was previously believed) and performed 'psychic surgery' that allowed him to control his powers for a time.<\/p><h4>Expert Technician<\/h4><p style=\"\">Emma Frost is highly skilled in electronic theory and electronics, and has learned how to build devices that can amplify psionic energy and utilize psionic energy for various effects. She devised the mechanism by which <a href=\"\/mastermind\/4005-8306\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8306\">Mastermind<\/a> projected his illusions directly into the mind of the <a href=\"\/phoenix-force\/4005-2164\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\">Phoenix Force<\/a>.<\/p><h4>Defense Training<\/h4><p style=\"\">Emma is a capable fighter in her own right. While in her diamond form, she was able to hold her own quite well against <a href=\"\/bishop\/4005-1503\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\">Bishop<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sage\/4005-4559\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4559\">Sage<\/a> until Bishop was forced to blast her away from the battlefield. She defeated half a dozen Sinister men with no powers for training right after her arm was just reconnected. Emma has fended off humans turned into lizard-like creatures without the need of her powers and also managed to fight well against a lizard-turned Wolverine, Gambit and Storm in diamond form before <a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man<\/a> showed up to help her. When she was a teacher for Generation X, Banshee planned to surprise Emma with an attack, but she quickly and easily thwarted him without the use of her powers, displaying her skill at unarmed combat even before she received official X-Men training in the area.<\/p><h2><b>Alternate Realities<\/b><\/h2><h3>Age of Apocalypse (Earth-295)<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-780050\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/39581\/780050-255px_emma_frost_earth_295.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"2.3529411764706\" data-width=\"255\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 255px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:235.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/39581\/780050-255px_emma_frost_earth_295.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-780050\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/39581\/780050-255px_emma_frost_earth_295.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/39581\/780050-255px_emma_frost_earth_295.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Age of Apocalypse<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In the <a href=\"..\/..\/age-of-apocalypse\/39-40752\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Age of Apocalypse<\/a> alternative reality, Emma never joins the <a href=\"..\/..\/hellfire-club\/65-13357\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hellfire Club<\/a> or even the X-Men. At some point in her past, she was lobotomized, which eliminated all traces of her mutant abilities. She still retains the visible scar on the side of her head, which her hair no longer grows upon.

Xavier and Frost became romantically involved while Xavier was still in a relationship with Mystique, causing Mystique to angrily lash out at Xavier in a grotesque form until Emma had to diamond-punch her. Emma was even responsible for the naming of Xavier's cat, saying it should be named Mystique when it destroyed his office in a similar manner to the actual Mystique. Emma and Charles, however, didn\u2019t make it as a couple. Frost leaves Xavier for mostly ideological differences as she thinks his approach to the mutant\/human relation was too violent. Frost is more passive towards working on the mutant\/human relation then Xavier. Frost goes back to Chicago and becomes a teacher giving mutant education seminars. The governor is very supportive of Frost's idea and helped introduce her to the <a href=\"..\/..\/white-house\/34-56318\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White House<\/a> chief of staff and eventually met the President.<\/p><p style=\"\">They come up with the New Mutants which is supposed to help educate humans about mutants while cutting ties with Xavies. During a press conference, Emma, the New Mutants, and even the President are attacked by <a href=\"..\/..\/sentinels\/65-4296\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sentinels<\/a>. Xavier and the X-Men came to help them. Xavier tried to convince Emma to come back to the school but she declined and returned to Chicago. In Chicago, she creates a new program called Academy of Tomorrow (the X-Men-like squad of the school being the Ultimate version of the New Mutants). She was later shown to be dating Shinobi Shaw (son of the deceased leader of the club, Sebastian Shaw). After Shinobi is arrested for attacking Jean Grey in order to release the Phoenix Force she was revealed to be the White Queen of this universe's Hellfire Club (wearing an outfit highly similar to her mainstream counterpart's White Queen garb) and requesting a new boyfriend. During the <a href=\"..\/..\/ultimatum\/39-55745\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimatum<\/a> event, she is later confirmed dead by <a href=\"..\/..\/madrox\/29-7910\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madrox<\/a> in issue #3.<\/p><p style=\"\">This version of Emma dresses more modestly and professionally than her mainstream counterpart, with even her initial outfit similar to her mainstream counterpart's White Queen costume showing very little skin. It is only when she is revealed as the White Queen that she wears the more revealing attire recognizable by her alternate counterpart. She also wore glasses most of the time (including as the White Queen). She also displays only her diamond form and is not shown using telepathy, though she was silenced before mentioning other powers.<\/p><h3><b>House of M (Earth-58163)<\/b><\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-204261\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/204261-161199-cyclops.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5915119363395\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:159.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/204261-161199-cyclops.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-204261\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/204261-161199-cyclops.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/204261-161199-cyclops.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>House of M<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">During the events of <a href=\"..\/..\/house-of-m\/39-40991\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">House of M<\/a>, Emma is a child therapist and is happily married to Cyclops and they have three kids.

Emma traveled with the survivors to the Savage Land and found a secret bunker set up by Nick Fury, who met them there. Emma was unable to pick up any psychic signatures in the Savage Land, but Ka-Zar was present there. She was also unable to penetrate the walls of the bunker.

Emma and Xavier were sent by Stark to send the Defenders (the group that replaced the Avengers and picked up Sue and Logan) back to their Defender Sanctorum. The group did not want to comply, and forced their way into the Starkguard Carrier despite Emma and Xavier's attempts to stop them. Amidst this conflict, Morgana Le Fay commenced another attack, drawing the full attention of the Defenders of S.H.I.E.L.D. Emma presumably joined in the fight.

Wolverine and Beast. The team investigates occurrences in New Albion (which is known as <a href=\"..\/..\/california\/34-55716\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">California<\/a>). Emma also refused Cyclops proposals stating her desire to avoid the \"tedious scandal\" so it would not cause any issues between the two of them. After a misunderstanding for being blamed for the deaths of the passengers in Hindenburg Disaster, the government placed the X-Society under house arrest so Emma migrated to <a href=\"..\/..\/europe\/34-56099\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Europe<\/a> and was married to Cyclops. She later reappeared as Emmeline Frost-Summers, having married Cyclops, in the \"Exaltation\" storyline in \"Astonishing X-Men\", when Scott Summers from Earth-616 had been kidnapped by an alternate version of Charles Xavier known as \"Savior\". The world that this Xavier lived in was literally breaking apart, and only the power of Scott's optic beams were able to hold it together. However the price of this was the ultimate sacrifice: death. So Savior abducted the Scott Summers of various alternate Earths sacrificing them against their will to maintain his own world. Earth-616 Scott broke Emmeline out of her prison, and along with alternate versions of Storm, Nightcrawler, and Wolverine (known as Howlett only), they attempted to stop Savior. Reinforcements soon arrived in the form of Earth-616's Emma Frost and Ororo Munroe, who fought beside their alternate Earth counterparts. Emma helped Emmeline up and the two launched a telepathic assault against Savior. Once Savior had been stopped, Emmeline and the other aforementioned members of Scott's crew decided to remain there and band together to save that Earth. Emmeline revealed that the Scott she married - the Scott of Earth-889 - had suffered the fate Savior intended. He had died holding the world together with the energy of his optic beams. This makeshift new team would later become ... the X-Treme X-Men! Kurt Waggoner of the United States of California, General Howlett of the Dominion of Canada, and Emmeline Frost-Summers of the New Albion X-Society would soon be joined by Earth-616's Alison Blaire, aka Dazzler. They would embark on a journey to save different realities. The only way they could do this was by killing the evil Charles Xaviers in each reality. In first reality they traveled to, they stumbled immediately into the Pantheon of the Gods: Namor, god of the sea, Thor, god of thunder, Sabretooth, god of the wild, Warran, god of the air and sky, Draka, god of ice and snow, and Storm, the All-Mother. Emmeline bows to the gods so as not to incur their wrath. Alison has a problem doing so. After a brief battle with the gods, Xavier and Magnus arrive to whisk the team away to their version of Utopia. Emmeline and the head of Xavier, however, remain as telepathic servants to the gods. The X-treme X-Men return along with Magnus and Xavier only to find that the Xavier they thought was good was really manipulating the gods into killing mortals. The X-treme X-Men saved and freed the gods. In return for their favor, the All-Mother Storm offered them godhood. Emmeline decided to accept the offer, and the All-Mother began the transformation process. Emmeline notes that the one thing she had that was a weakness was her heart (emotion). The process of granting her godhood had removed that one weakness, and in the process, Emmeline's flesh turned to flawless diamond. Emmeline became the Diamond Queen, goddess of perfection and the mind.<\/p><h3><b>Age of Xavier (Earth-77995)<\/b><\/h3><p style=\"\">Emma is a member of the Hellfire Club and is married to Iceman.

She is next seen going to meet with a Russian general who Shaw is supposed to meet. Professor Xavier and Magneto also infiltrate the building Emma is in and confront her. She is then captured and taken to the CIA headquarters. Months later, Magneto and his Brotherhood free her from her prison and ask her to join them, to which she agrees. She displays incredibly impressive telepathy defeating and blocking out Charles Xavier several times. She also possesses her diamond form which seems to augment her strength (she was able to send Erik flying into the sea with a single blow) and renders her immune to telepathy. However it does not seem to provide her any physical durability as Erik almost killed her by strangling her with the metal railing of a bed while she was in diamond form (a close up clearly shows it beginning to shatter around the area the pressure was applied, her neck) and Charles had to persuade him not to kill her, which he surely would have. In this incarnation, Emma seems to play more of a henchman-type second-in-command role rather than more of an equal power player as she was in the comics when she was the White Queen.<\/p><h3><b><u>Video Games<\/u><\/b><\/h3><h4><b>X-Men Legends<\/b><\/h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1928643\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/75086\/1928643-emma_frost1.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/75086\/1928643-emma_frost1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1928643\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/75086\/1928643-emma_frost1.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/75086\/1928643-emma_frost1.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>X-Men Legends Emma<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Emma Frost is a playable character in X-Men Legends. She is unlocked as a Non-Playable character (NPC) after the Nuclear Power plant level where you save Colossus. She only becomes playable after Alison speaks with her and Charles Xavier at the Mansion. The depiction of Emma in this game is quite faithful to her comic book counterpart, aside from her attraction to Professor X rather than Cyclops. Her active powers in the game are: Confuse, Fear, Psychic Shell and Psychic Bedlam. She is voiced by Bobby Holliday.<\/p><h4><b>X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse<\/b><\/h4><p style=\"\">She also appeared in it's sequel as a NPC who helped the X-Men in their mission in Madri Temple after she telepathically contacted Professor X about the Stepford Cuckoos starting rebellion in Madri. She was taken for her harmonic DNA by Sinister. She was used to make Apocalypse stronger for the last battle. She is voiced by Bobby Holliday again.<\/p><h4><b>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance<\/b><\/h4><p style=\"\">Emma is one of the X-Men who are defeated by Dr. Doom during the CG video \"Doomsday\".

Although Emma is one of the four characters we actually see being brainwashed by Doom, the player doesn't fight her later in the game.<\/p><h4><b>X-Men Destiny<\/b><\/h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3401046\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/3401046-eeeee.png\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"2.2390243902439\" data-width=\"205\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 205px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:223.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/3401046-eeeee.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3401046\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/3401046-eeeee.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/3401046-eeeee.png\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>X-men Destiny<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Emma Frost is one of the non-playable characters and is introduced as the leader of the X-Men alongside Cyclops.<\/p><p style=\"\">She uses her telepathy to guide the player through the game regarding how to use their powers, where to go next, and at times she'll physically meet up with you.

While trying to set the winged horse free, an army began to charge at her. Unwilling to leave the horse helpless and not willing to run, Dani chose to fight back, which led her to using her telepathic abilities to draw forth the image that the oncoming warriors feared most, <a href=\"\/hela\/4005-4342\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4342\">Hela<\/a> Asgardian Goddess of Death. The enemies froze in fear and left immediately, without a backwards glance. Dani not recognizing who the image was, cared less and returned to the winged-horse and freed it. The horse instantly began to trust and bonded with Dani. The horse was one of the winged-steeds of the Valkyor who had chosen her to be a Valkyrie; one of the choosers of the slain. It is possible that Dani\u2019s moments of seeing her parents and grandfather\u2019s deaths may have indicated a previously existing mystical ability in this area.<\/p><p style=\"\">The New Mutants joined forces with the <a href=\"\/x-men\/4060-3173\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men<\/a> to defeat Loki. The steed, which Dani named <a href=\"\/brightwind\/4005-28987\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28987\">Brightwind<\/a> returned to Earth with her. Upon her connection with <a href=\"\/brightwind\/4005-28987\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28987\">Brightwind<\/a> Dani was very different though, in powers as well as responsibilities. Dani was no longer just a human mutant but a Valkyrie. This title gifted her with the ability to \"see\" death, or an aura of death around individuals who were to die soon. This gift also allowed Dani the ability to fight Death itself. On a couple of occasions, Dani attempted to fight Death to save the lives of those around her, though she was not always successful and learned that Death was a natural process of life not always to be feared.<\/p><h3>Leaving the New Mutants<\/h3><p style=\"\">Later, when <a href=\"\/hela\/4005-4342\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4342\">Hela<\/a> attempted to take over Asgard, Dani found herself trapped under the sway of Hela along with the rest of the Valkyor. She attempted to kill <a href=\"\/odin\/4005-3507\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\">Odin<\/a>, but the New Mutants combined with the Asgardians defeated Hela\u2019s forces, freeing the Valkyor and Dani. Dani then chose to remain behind in Asgard to help repair the damage she had done.<\/p><h3>Return To Earth<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/185343-169557-moonstar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-185343\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.32\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:132.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/185343-169557-moonstar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-185343\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6754\/185343-169557-moonstar.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6754\/185343-169557-moonstar.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Mutant Liberation Front<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Eventually, Dani returned to earth and unbeknownst to any of her friends she joined <a href=\"\/shield\/4060-3775\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD<\/a>. As a SHIELD operative, she took on a mission to go undercover in the <a href=\"\/mutant-liberation-front\/4060-28349\" data-ref-id=\"4060-28349\">Mutant Liberation Front<\/a> (MLF), using the code name Moonstar. Purposefully withholding information of her recent past, she would use her powers against her old team-mates, while serving as an informant for <a href=\"\/cable\/4005-2157\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable<\/a>. Dani was forced to take on a harder, darker persona, almost changing herself completely, including her mutant powers. Dani was able to refine her psychic abilities to the point were she focus he mental energies to create \"Psychic Arrows.\" These same \"arrows\" once connected with there intended target would incapacitate them, by either knocking them unconscious, temporarily paralysing or befuddle them and they would begin to make incoherent noise; completely taking the out of a fight. Not only did Dani take on a darker appearance in mind and body, but it also changed Brightwind. No longer bright at all, her Pegasus was not white, but completely black and now call Darkwind.<\/p><p style=\"\">While apart of the MLF Dani struggled with her \"undercover status\" as it put her at odds with herself. An unfortunate side affect to her \"deep cover\" was that it brought her into many conflicts with old allies <a href=\"\/x-force\/4060-15595\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\">X-Force<\/a> which was largely comprised of former <a href=\"\/new-mutants\/4060-15971\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\">New Mutants<\/a>.

A few minutes later, Moonstar reverted back to flesh and blood, and it seemed that nothing had changed. X-Force and Arcadia parted ways, unaware of the side effects that this incident would cause.<\/p><p style=\"\">Over the next days and weeks, Moonstar discovered that her body had been altered on a molecular level and that she possessed a new power. She could now channel the quantum energies that make up the universe, which allowed her to affect matter at a subatomic level. Actually learning-by-doing, Dani found a way to perceive these quantum energies as interconnected particles and waves. She found she could affect those connections, changing the physical nature of all things, including an electromagnetic field such as the one generated by <a href=\"\/magneto\/4005-1441\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto<\/a> during X-Force\u2019s encounter with him in <a href=\"\/genosha\/4020-40967\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genosha<\/a>. It was not only Moonstar who had been changed, but Arcadia too.

Moonstar and DeVille were both consumed by the Bear, who wanted to add their powers to his own. However, from within, the two women tried to re-absorb the energies that had been used in his creation. Evidently it worked, as the Bear was destroyed, but Arcadia could not handle the increased power level and retreated deep within her own mind. She transformed herself into the Queen of the Star Swords, an evil character from one of her childhood tales. Perceiving Moonstar as a potential threat, she split her apart with four different Moonstars appearing, each representing different aspect of Dani - New Mutant, Valkyrie, M.L.F., and quantum-powered, while the real Moonstar was left a powerless husk.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/435\/78322-46483-moonstar.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-78322\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4057142857143\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/435\/78322-46483-moonstar.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-78322\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/435\/78322-46483-moonstar.gif\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/435\/78322-46483-moonstar.gif\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>With the X-Men<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Out of thin air, the Queen created a cathedral in a dimensional rift as her headquarters and, venturing inside, X-Force became lost in different alternate timelines. Eventually, they could track down the Moonstar-fragments and Dani was reunited. Using her abilities in combination, Moonstar ended the threat of the Queen \/ Arcadia, as she channeled the entire might of her quantum-based powers into a psionic arrow, which sealed the rift and returned Arcadia to normal. Their link severed, Dani no longer could access the quantum energies and was back to her psionic arrows and emotional illusion casting.<\/p><p style=\"\">Later some members of X-Force decided to get the British black op <a href=\"\/pete-wisdom\/4005-14819\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14819\">Pete Wisdom<\/a> to train them and improve their effectiveness. However, Moonstar, like <a href=\"\/domino\/4005-2161\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2161\">Domino<\/a>, could not agree with his methods and quit the team. Instead, she joined the <a href=\"\/x-men\/4060-3173\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men<\/a> on a part-time basis, whilst she attended college classes in her spare time.

She became involved with Xavier\u2019s school again when she learned of the plight of a young mutant in nearby Denver. Young <a href=\"\/sofia-mantega\/4005-40537\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40537\">Sofia Mantega<\/a> had been sent to her father, who didn\u2019t want her. After being ignored by her father and ridiculed by her fellow students for months, she snapped and used her mutant powers to control the wind to cause havoc at one of her father\u2019s supermarkets. Her father was willing to leave her in jail but Dani interceded and got him to agree that she could take Sofia to Xavier\u2019s school.<\/p><p style=\"\">Seeing Dani\u2019s good instincts with Sofia and a fellow student, <a href=\"\/wallflower\/4005-40535\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40535\">Laurie Collins<\/a>, Xavier suggested Dani become a teacher at the institute. Dani was unwilling at first and instead Xavier asked her to contact several mutants located by Cerebra in his name. Dani recruited two more kids and was reunited with fellow former New Mutant, Xi\u2019an Coy Manh, along the way. Dani joined the X-Men as an affiliate member, recruiting and teaching\/ training students at the <a href=\"\/xavier-institute\/4060-40473\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40473\">Xavier Institute<\/a>, even becoming a guardian for <a href=\"\/elixir\/4005-4552\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\">Elixir<\/a> when his parents completely rejected him. She eventually took over the training of the New Mutant Squad.

Remembering her only to well from her villain days as the Hellfire Club\u2019s White Queen, Dani didn\u2019t get along with Emma and, before long, their feud carried over to the two training squads tutored by them, the New Mutants and the Hellions. Even worse, when Dani wanted to bring <a href=\"\/wither\/4005-40511\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40511\">Kevin Ford<\/a> back to the school, she needed Emma\u2019s help to operate Cerebra and pinpoint his location. It was Emma who convinced the boy to return but, only a few days later, the FBI wanted to arrest him for apparently killing his own father. At first, Dani was against turning him over to the authorities but eventually was convinced otherwise. Surprisingly, the court declared the death of Kevin\u2019s father and accident and he was allowed to return to Xavier\u2019s, though the damage was done. He no longer trusted Danielle one bit and asked to be transferred to Emma\u2019s squad. The incident still had a pleasant side-effect for Danielle, as she became romantically involved with <a href=\"\/justin-pierce\/4005-11913\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11913\">Justin Pierce<\/a>, the FBI agent assigned to the case.<\/p><h3>M-Day<\/h3><p style=\"\">Dani was one of the many Mutants whose powers were removed by the <a href=\"\/decimation\/4045-43626\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43626\">Decimation<\/a>. <a href=\"\/emma-frost\/4005-1457\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost<\/a> made Dani leave the school along with all the other mutants who had been de-powered.

Furious, Dani drives away. Cannonball, Magma and Sunspot then attempt to fight Legion while Illyana tries to salvage the situation from within Legion's own mind. One by one, Legion takes down the three mutants using the different abilities of his hostile personalities. When Legion finally shifts to a werewolf-like form to regenerate his wounds and finish off a helpless Cannonball, Dani returns in time to ram Legion with her vehicle and prevent Sam from being killed. Despite ramming Legion into a wall and stabbing him with her knife, the omega level mutant still gains the upper hand. Before he can kill Dani, Illyana succeeds in freeing Shan and David Haller's base personality from within Legion's mind, and ending the ordeal.

However, when she is gone, horrible soul-eating monsters, the D\u2019siri, attack and devour several of the souls, despite Tyr\u2019s attempt to protect them. When she realizes what is happening, Dani returns and chases away the D\u2019siri, but too late for some of the souls. She tells Tyr that he is wounded but still alive and has him rejoin the living. She then brings the remaining souls to Hela, ashamed that she was wrong and Hela was actually trying to save them.<\/p><h3>Second Coming<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/53420\/1231467-nm13_hope4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1231467\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.72578125\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/53420\/1231467-nm13_hope4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1231467\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/53420\/1231467-nm13_hope4.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/53420\/1231467-nm13_hope4.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Hope punches Dani<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">During <a href=\"\/second-coming\/4045-55971\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55971\">Second Coming<\/a>, Cyclops sanctions Dani and the New Mutants (minus Illyana) in a holding pattern over the Midwest aboard the Blackbird.

They are ordered not to let Hodge send his team to help the Purifiers. The team engage the soldiers in battle. Dani takes part in the battle, regardless of being powerless, using her fighting abilities to engage the soldiers in battle. The team are forced to retreat after Karma's leg is mutilated by Hodge, while Warlock kills him and his forces with his powers. Back on the plane Dani tries to help Karma with her wound. After they return, Dani attends <a href=\"\/nightcrawler\/4005-1461\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler<\/a>'s funeral.

During this time, Dani and Sam become extremely drunk and start flirting which leads to them kissing. They are interrupted by Illyana who senses an upcoming danger through her Soulsword and that <a href=\"\/pixie\/4005-40673\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40673\">Pixie<\/a> has been kidnapped.

Loca turned around to see Dani using her bow, pulling the string with one of her feet. \"Good girl\" she mocked and shot her torturer straight through the chest with her arrow.

The team easily defeat the robot, until they notice that everyone that was sent on the mission has a connection to Illyana. The team head back to Utopia, where Dani visits Karma and <a href=\"\/face\/4005-74515\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74515\">Face<\/a>. Dani tells Karma that Face is potentially very dangerous. She agrees but says that he needs her, like Sam needs Dani. She visits Sam in the psychiatric ward. Dani expresses her discomfort at visiting Sam at what appears like a jail. Moonstar tells him that he created the second generation and he should lead it, but Sam still feels he needs to heal. However, Dani feels that there is no team anymore and that she fears Cyclops is going to break them up and re-assign them. Sam states that it's Cyclops call, but that whatever happens from here, he still gets to to do this. A puzzled Dani wonders what until she's interrupted by Sam kissing her. She then says that he can and they continue to kiss. After this, Dani visits Cyclops. Where he tells her, to her surprise, that he's not dissolving the team, but rather making her the leader. He then tells her the team will now handle loose ends, to deal with unfinished business. And that their first mission is to find and bring Nate Grey, <a href=\"\/x-man\/4005-15051\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15051\">X-Man<\/a>, home.<\/p><h3>Fear Itself<\/h3><p style=\"\">When the Asgardian evil known as the Serpent sent hammers of power to Midgard to empower the evil, the Juggernaut received one such hammer, and went on a rampage across America on his way to San Francisco to destroy the X-Men on Utopia. While Scott Summers and his X-Men attempted to delay the Juggernaut, Dani was sent to Las Vegas, the location of Hel on Midgard, to ask the Asgardian goddess of death, Hela, for help. Dani, acting as Hel's Valkyrie, arrived in Hel only to find that it had been overrun by evil beings - a special kind of evil. They were demons that had been previously slain by Odin. A blackbird had been guiding Dani along and had been at her side since she arrived. Unbeknownst to Dani, it was the soul of Hela. After battling the demonic creatures, Dani was swallowed whole. The rest of the New Mutants decided to find Dani. Illyana, who was locked away at the time, taught Doug a spell to get them to Hel. He misspoke the spell, and the team ended up in Hell - two \"L\"s - which was Mephisto's realm. After Amara agreed to go on a date with the devil, he teleported the team to Hel - one \"L\". Dani cut her way out of the beast that had swallowed her whole after the presence of her friends was made known to her by Hela's soul - the blackbird. They fought their way to the palace of Hela only to find Hela's lifeless body impaled on the tallest spire of the palace. The New Mutants barricaded themselves inside the palace, and a morose Dani monologued to Hela's corpse as the others prepared for battle. The blackbird returned to Hela's body. With her soul back in her body, Hela was healed and with the help of the New Mutants - especially her Valkyrie, or \"Dark Angel\", Dani - the evil was dispelled and the demon creatures were destroyed. Hela sent the team back to San Francisco, where they discovered that the Juggernaut problem had been dealt with by their own <a href=\"\/magik\/4005-8303\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\">Illyana Rasputina<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Marvel Now! Fearless Defenders<\/h3><p style=\"\">Dani was targeted by the henchmen of Caroline Le Fay, who believed her to be an easy target because of her status as a depowered mutant. However, Dani was prepared for her unwanted guests, and unleashed a volley of arrows on the closest attackers, taking them out with ease. She was able to take down many of the henchmen before finally being taken to Le Fay's base of operations. Le Fay intended to use Dani as a conduit to awaken the <a href=\"\/disir\/4060-57459\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57459\">D\u00edsir<\/a> - the original Valkyries, the Valkyries of Bor. Dani was freed by Valkyrie (Brunhilde), Misty Knight, and Hippolyta (Hela's chosen champion). Dani joined the women and resumed her position as Hel's Valkyrie. After battling the <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/D%C3%ADsir_(Earth-616)\" rel=\"nofollow\">D\u00edsir<\/a>, Valkyrie became aware that she was once one of them - she was the Maiden of Rage, but her memory of this time had been erased.

(joining their <a href=\"\/hellions\/4060-3199\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3199\">Hellions<\/a> training squad) for a spy and covert ops\/military type training. In the House of M, Danielle chose S.H.I.E.L.D. and is the field agent in charge of training the Hellions training squad, although an agent she actively participates in missions. Unlike in the regular 616 reality, Karma and Moonstar are not friends, and often bump heads as Karma is the leader of the New Mutants. She also appears to be without powers in this reality.

In this reality, Danielle is capture and placed in a coma in a newly created Neverland Ranch located on the blue side of the moon. Whilst she is in a coma many of her friends in the X-Men whom she has known for years are killed, and she was unable to help. During an attack on Xavier Institute, Wolfsbane was caught in an explosion while attempting to save the lives of the students. In her last dying thoughts she called out to Dani for help. Through Dani's telepathic connection to Rahne while in her lupine form, Wolfsbane provided her with enough energy to try to break out of her coma. She began to chant spells and mystical runes manifested above &amp; around her body. The scientists on the moon were unnerved and decided to kill her. After her death Dani awoke as someone who was no longer a mutant or even a human being. Danielle Moonstar transformed into a Valkyrie, finally reaching her potential. She destroys Neverland Ranch as her final help to her allies on Earth, but then leaves Earth never to return. Thereafter, she later helped destroy Hela and took her place as the Norse Goddess of Death and ruler of Hel.<\/p><h3>Earth #8720 (New Mutants #48 &amp; 50)<\/h3><p style=\"\">Most of the X-Men, if not all, and the New Mutants were killed by Sentinels in their initial attack. The New Mutants were reduced to a trio consisting of an aged Cannonball, his lover Lila Cheney and a very embittered &amp; war-torn Danielle Moonstar. They devised a plan to gather the remaining mutants together and use Lila's intergalactic teleportation powers to safely leave Earth and head to another planet.

Though only a few X-Men accept and stay, all but three of the New Mutants remain in Asgard effectively putting an end to the group as a whole. Those that remained in Asgard dramatically change history there and most take on important roles. Danielle Moonstar battles and defeats Hela the Goddess of Death and takes her role becoming the new Goddess of Death, ruling over her domain of Hel.<\/p><h3>Earth #?<\/h3><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/marvel-mangaverse\/4015-46090\" data-ref-id=\"4015-46090\">Marvel Mangaverse<\/a><\/p><p style=\"\">In this reality Danielle Moonstar uses the codename Mirage and is a member of the X-Men.

When Shadowcat has an accident, she believes that she has survived uninjured by phasing and befriended a girl who introduced herself as Danielle. Danielle confessed that she is also a mutant and admires Kitty for the powers that she has. For this reason, she convinced her to join the Institute. Danielle had a hard time adjusting with other mutants. She also did not have control of her powers, causing her to traumatize everyone with fearful illusions even in their sleep.<\/p><p style=\"\">As Kitty wakes up the next day, she looks for Danielle in the Institute but no one remembers her. Kitty blames Professor X, believing he must have deleted their memories but the reality is that no one named Danielle Moonstar has ever existed at the Institute.

She asked assistance from Nightcrawler to teleport to Dani's hometown.<\/p><p style=\"\">As Nightcrawler and Kitty explore the town, a mysterious call from a phone booth captures Kitty's attention and she answers it. It was Dani asking for help. With the help of a directory, she found Dani's address and followed it. There they met Black Eagle, who told them that Danielle had been missing for two years and was presumed dead. Nightcrawler believed that a Dani Moonstar existed but did not know how she met Kitty. Kitty did not lose hope and went to where she met Dani. Kitty heard and followed Dani's voice even without Kurt's permission. She phased under and saw Danielle unconscious.Kitty was surprised and happy to prove to herself that Dani was real. Kurt was worried, and asked help from the X-Men. The X-Men worked together to create a passageway for them to enter where Kitty had phased through. Meanwhile, Kitty awakened Danielle but she confessed that she can't phase out because it was too high for her. Kitty then heard the X-Men. Kurt teleported in and saved the two girls.<\/p><p style=\"\">As the situation calms down, Dani is brought to the Institute.

Wanda is also the fraternal twin sister of Pietro ( <a href=\"\/quicksilver\/4005-1467\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver<\/a>) ; she was born first of the two. Shortly after Magda became pregnant, she witnessed her husband use his magnetic powers and realized that he was a mutant. Being terrified of mutants, Magda did not tell him of her pregnancy and fled from their home at the first opportunity. Magda eventually found refuge with a benevolent cow-like humanoid named <a href=\"\/bova\/4005-11503\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11503\">Bova<\/a>, who lived on <a href=\"\/wundagore-mountain-transia\/4020-41286\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41286\">Mount Wundagore<\/a> in Transia. The twins were born on Mt. Wundagore, and due to the mountain's mystical energy, it gave Wanda the ability to use magic in addition to her mutant powers. Shortly after the birth, Magda was driven mad with fear that Magneto might come for her and discover the twins. Despite Bova's attempts to reassure her, she fled the mountain during a blizzard in order to protect the twins, and apparently died of exposure soon afterward.<\/p><p style=\"\">The motherless twins became the responsibility of Bova. A short time later, Bova helped a World War II heroine named <a href=\"\/miss-america\/4005-13779\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13779\">Miss America<\/a> give birth to a child fathered by her superhero husband, the <a href=\"\/whizzer\/4005-11840\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11840\">Whizzer<\/a>, but unfortunately both child and mother died from radiation poisoning soon afterward. After Whizzer arrived, Bova only told him that Miss America had died, and gave him Pietro and Wanda to care for, claiming they were his children. Whizzer initially took the twins with him, but once he discovered they were not his own, he immediately returned them to Bova on Mt.

Django and Marya were Roma (gypsies), and unfortunately suffered from prejudice and persecution in Transia. Django worked as a doll-maker, but it was hard for him to find customers due to him being Roma. Django eventually had to steal food to keep his family from starving. When Wanda grew older, she was sexually molested by a boy her age, and was forced to use her powers to keep him away before running to safety. The villagers, however, accused Wanda of seducing the boy and attacked the Maximoffs, setting fire to the family\u2019s wagon. Marya was still inside and burned to death. They clubbed Django unconscious, but Wanda and Pietro were able to escape. Wanda and Pietro now believed that they were the only members of their family left. The two twins grew up together taking care of themselves, and Pietro grew very protective of Wanda.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p style=\"\">The Scarlet Witch was created by <a href=\"\/stan-lee\/4040-40467\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee<\/a> and <a href=\"\/jack-kirby\/4040-5614\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby<\/a> and first appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/the-x-men-4-the-brotherhood-of-evil-mutants\/4000-7032\" data-ref-id=\"4000-7032\">The X-Men #4 <\/a>(1964).<\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><h3>Silver Age<\/h3><p style=\"\">Scarlet Witch has been through some major changes in her comics career.Wanda began her career as a mutant on the side of evil, being a member of Magneto's <a href=\"\/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants\/4060-17652\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17652\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants<\/a>.

Wonder Man was counseled by Wasp (who could not have children of her own and questioned the existence of Wanda\u2019s children), who convinced him to not allow anyone to use his memories to restore the Vision\u2019s.<\/p><h3>Fading Children<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/374024-125813-scarlet-witch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-374024\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/374024-125813-scarlet-witch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-374024\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/374024-125813-scarlet-witch.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/374024-125813-scarlet-witch.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Vision and Scarlet Witch<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Wanda\u2019s children began to fade in and out of existence.

One of Mephisto\u2019s minions kidnapped Wanda\u2019s children and reabsorbed them back into Mephisto. The Avengers attempted to rescue the children but failed. Agatha erased a grief-stricken Wanda\u2019s memories of her twins and helped the Avengers escape from Mephisto\u2019s realm.<\/p><p style=\"\">Everyone\u2019s life went on, with Vision still having no memories and showing little concern for Wanda on the battlefield. Vision eventually decided to leave the West Coast team to join the East Coast roster. Wanda begged Vision to stay by her side, but he told her that the East Coast needed him more then she did. This led to Wanda having a nervous breakdown and helping found a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, along with Magneto (who had returned to Earth) and Quicksilver. Pietro soon revealed that he only joined Magneto to take back his fragile sister. The West Coast Avengers tried to save Wanda but she was then kidnapped by Immortus. Immortus revealed that he had manipulated Wanda\u2019s relationship with Vision in order to destroy the android, and this process made Wanda emotionally fragile.<\/p><h3>Force Works and return to the Avengers<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18318\/348926-153503-scarlet-witch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-348926\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.1004566210046\" data-width=\"219\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 219px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:210.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18318\/348926-153503-scarlet-witch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-348926\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/18318\/348926-153503-scarlet-witch.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/18318\/348926-153503-scarlet-witch.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Force Works<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">During the process, Wanda\u2019s mutant power connected her to multiple parallel universes.

Wanda became the leader of the West Coast Avengers, but soon left to become a founding member of a new team called <a href=\"\/force-works\/4060-14245\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14245\">Force Works<\/a>. The ill-fated team did not last long, and Wonder Man died on the first Force Works mission. The group disbanded and Wanda rejoined the West Coast Avengers.

It was however not much later that Wanda was kidnapped by the sorceress Morgan Le Fey. She was able to escape, and resurrected Wonder Man to ghost form in the process. Le Fey battled Vision and wounded him badly. Vision tells Wanda not to visit him because of his current status and her fragile mind. Wanda revisited Agatha Harkness where she learns that her mutant powers were still evolving. She is able to now channel Chaos Magic which is considered very dangerous by professional magicians. Wanda also learns that she can resurrect the dead now. After she was rejected by Vision so much, she decided to revive Wonder Man and pursue a relationship with him. They began having an obvious affair right in front of Vision who had his entire memories restored. However, their relationship would go nowhere after Wonder Man reveals that he does not want to get married and have children. Wanda dumped Wonder Man right after that. Soon Wanda and Vision would reconcile and try to rebuild their relationship. Wanda began using her Chaos Magic more and it started to consume her with chaos energy.<\/p><h3>Avengers Disassembled<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2532\/139886-35831-avengers-disassemble.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-139886\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2532\/139886-35831-avengers-disassemble.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-139886\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/2532\/139886-35831-avengers-disassemble.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/2532\/139886-35831-avengers-disassemble.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Wasp's troubling revelation<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">When the Wasp began a romantic relationship with Hawkeye, she would constantly talk to Wanda about the developments of their romance. One day after Wasp had a few drinks, she revealed to Wanda that she once had children that were hidden to her. This triggered something deep inside Wanda\u2019s mind. She sought out her former teacher, Agatha Harkness to learn the truth, and murdered Agatha for the betrayal. She went on to exact her revenge on her fellow Avengers. She hit each of them unexpectedly. At this point Wanda was believed not to be in her right mind, driven mad by her immense power and the memory of the children she lost. It is highly likely that what she did to the other Avengers was unknown even to her, and their destruction was created on a subconscious level.<\/p><p style=\"\">First the corpse of <a href=\"\/jack-of-hearts\/4005-7213\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7213\">Jack Of Hearts<\/a> was raised from the grave and blew up the Avengers Mansion, killing Scott Lang. It is not fully known whether this was actually Scott Lang's body, if his mind was in the body at the time of the attack, or if it was simply a construct generated by Wanda's magics which was meant to resemble the former Avenger. Next during a U.N. meeting where Iron Man was speaking, the unmasked Tony Stark became overwhelmed with the sensation of drunkenness despite his long term sobriety. He called out the <a href=\"\/latveria\/4020-41031\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latverian<\/a> ambassador, talking about how the entire country should be wiped off the map, and threatening to kill the politician where he stood. Before Hank Pym was able to lecture Tony, Wanda's Avengers communicator signaled a code white, signaling that they were needed at the Mansion. As Stark flew off the United States Chief of Staff called him, informing him that he was being forced to resign from his position within the government.<\/p><p style=\"\">Back at the mansion, SHIELD had arrived at the scene to lend assistance and investigate. The Vision flew in on an Avengers Quinjet, crashing into the side of the building. An apologetic Vision emerged from the rubble and ejected several metal orbs which grew into <a href=\"\/ultron\/4005-2242\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron<\/a> robots. The Ultrons attacked the Avengers, sending <a href=\"\/she-hulk\/4005-1449\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk<\/a> into a blind rage. After the Ultron robots were defeated She-Hulk ripped the body of the Vision in half, destroying him. <a href=\"\/iron-man\/4005-1455\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man<\/a> arrived just in time to incapacitate her, but not before she had severely injured both Wasp and Lionheart.<\/p><p style=\"\">At this point Wanda had either killed or taken several of her teammates out of action, most likely still not even realizing that she was behind the attacks. The remaining Avengers had little time to try to figure out what was happening or who was attacking them before returning to the Mansion. When they returned they found <a href=\"\/nick-fury\/4005-3202\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury<\/a> as well as many past members who were close enough to assemble, and a few friends of the team. Fury was trying to get the superheroes who had arrived to leave so that they didn't mess up his investigation when a group of Kree warriors (generated by Wanda's magic) flew in to attack. During the attack on the Avengers, Hawkeye sacrificed himself to bring down the Kree warship.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25835\/774746-roughpromo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-774746\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.305057096248\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:130.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25835\/774746-roughpromo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-774746\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/25835\/774746-roughpromo.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/25835\/774746-roughpromo.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>With teammates Ms. Marvel and Wasp<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After the destruction of the ship the remaining Kree fled and <a href=\"\/doctor-strange\/4005-1456\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange<\/a> arrived to inform them that the attacks on the Avengers were magic based. He declared Wanda to be insane due to her possession of reality altering abilities that were beyond her comprehension or control. He was aghast that she had been allowed to live her life without checks and balances, saying anyone who had such a powerful control over probability would have a lost their grasp on reality. He scolded the Avengers for not consulting with him about Wanda\u2019s past. He also reveals that there is no such thing as \u201cChaos Magic.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"\">Strange led the Avengers to Wanda who had began creating a fake reality around her composed of those she cared for. The arrival of the Avengers threatened this peace, and the existence of the children that she had once again willed into being. Wanda summoned new constructs of heroes and villains to battle the group of superheroes, and created demons to battle Strange. She was no match for Strange's power, and she was immobilized by him. It was then that Magneto, hearing of his daughter's mental break, arrived to rescue her. Magneto took Wanda back to Genosha in hopes of healing her broken mind.<\/p><h3>House of M<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2462633\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/52185\/2462633-scan0018_4.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.3888888888889\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/52185\/2462633-scan0018_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2462633\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/52185\/2462633-scan0018_4.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/52185\/2462633-scan0018_4.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">While in <a href=\"\/genosha\/4020-40967\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genosha<\/a>, <a href=\"\/magneto\/4005-1441\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto<\/a> asked <a href=\"\/professor-x\/4005-1505\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X<\/a> to help Wanda but he refuses to do so.

A horrified Pietro immediately came to Wanda and told her of this. He convinced her, while she was in this fragile mental state, to distort probability to create a new reality, called House of M. In this new reality, the mutant:human ratio was reversed, and Magneto was the supreme ruler (hence, House of M).

Billy is able to talk her out of it by revealing that he believes himself and Speed to be her reincarnated children.

She realizes that they are in fact her children and she, Billy, and Thomas tearfully embrace each other. <a href=\"\/beast\/4005-1462\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast<\/a> suggests that Wanda absolve herself of her crimes by attempting to reverse the effects of M-Day.

He will use the brain of Charles Xavier to overtake the minds of a large populace and turn the rebuilding world into chaos which is already very anti-mutant. Captain America already had a plan for a joint Avengers and X-Men team based off of a need to rebuild the destroyed cooperation between the two large factions of superheroes in the Marvel Universe. As happens often with hero teams the heroes come together under fire as opposed to being assembled on purpose. In this case it starts at the grave of Charles Xavier as Rogue and the Scarlet Witch almost comes to blows over the past as they discuss the recent events of which both have had a part (which has been often conflicting.) At the same time they are attacked by the Red Skull who enacts his plan to gain access to Xavier's power. He takes them hostage and after gaining the power to mentally control them he heads to <a href=\"\/new-york-city\/4020-41183\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York City<\/a> where the Avengers are busy trying to rebuild. He successively takes control of more heroes while others escape from his power. <a href=\"\/thor\/4005-2268\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor<\/a> and Scarlet Witch are engaged in a battle while the Red Skull has taken control of Captain America and Wolverine has already been incapacitated. Havoc enters the mix and tries to help battle Thor but realizing they are outmatched Scarlet Witch decides the only action which makes sense is to remove Thor from the battle and sends him to outer space temporarily. Meanwhile Rogue has broken free from her power by assuming the power negation from <a href=\"\/goat-faced-girl\/4005-85991\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85991\">Goat Faced Girl<\/a> and knocks out Red Skull's power temporarily. He shoots her and regains his power and convinces <a href=\"\/havok\/4005-3546\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\">Havoc<\/a> to attack her. Not realizing that Captain America is now freed of control he attacks the Red Skull who realizes that the momentum has turned against him and retreats. Scarlet Witch later visits Rogue in the hospital and asks for a truce and a return to their old friendship. She declines and indicates that the only reason that she is staying with the <a href=\"\/uncanny-avengers\/4060-59251\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59251\">Uncanny Avengers<\/a> is because Xavier would have wanted it and because she wants to keep an eye on Scarlet Witch (as she has also already agreed to join the team.)<\/p><h3>AXIS and the High Evolutionary<\/h3><p style=\"\">As time goes on, Wanda eventually becomes closer to Rogue. During the events of <a href=\"\/axis\/4045-58113\" data-ref-id=\"4045-58113\"><em>AXIS<\/em><\/a>, she ends up being Inverted and is turned evil. She is combated by Doctor Doom (now a hero thanks to the Inversion) and his makeshift team of substitute Avengers.

By a combination of gestures and mental concentration, she creates a hex-sphere, a finite pocket of reality-disrupting quasi-psionic force, which upon reaching its intended target, causes disturbance in the molecular-level probability field surrounding the target. Thus, unlikely phenomena will occur. Among the many phenomena she is able to cause are: the sudden melting of gun barrels, the spontaneous combustion of any flammable object, the rapid rust or decay of various organic and inorganic materials, the poltergeist-like deflection of an object in flight, the sudden evacuation of air from a given volume, the disruption of energy transmissions and fields, and so on. These phenomena occur practically instantaneously after the completion of her hex. Her range of hex-casting is limited by her line of sight. (She cannot watch a live television broadcast and cause a hex-phenomenon to occur at its point of origin.)<\/p><p style=\"\">Scarlet Witch's hex-casting ability had a 20% unreliable factor and she is limited in the range of sight, although she has been able to overcome the latter limitation on occasion via extreme concentration and sorcerous enchantment.<\/p><p style=\"\">Wanda is also a living focal point for the earth's magic. Her sorcerous training with Agatha Harkness is separate from her mutant ability of probability (science). But the mixture of the two makes her considerably more powerful than just using her probability powers. She has a special affinity for the natural elements and materials that true witches utilize in their spells: the four alchemical elements, wood, organic substances, etc. The reliability factor of her hex-casting ability is also limited by her physical condition: when well rested, in good health and mentally and emotionally alert Scarlet Witch can cast numerous hex-spheres in rapid succession and attain desirable results for almost an hour. However, certain events in House of M, have shown that her limits may have been removed altogether. And her powers actually evolved, giving her the mutant ability to alter reality on a vast scale by way of magic<\/p><p style=\"\">In the House of M storyline, Wanda showed that she could fly, transform people and matter, fire powerful beams of magic, and disable other mutants abilities. She could also bring the dead back to life. And while it appears that Scarlet Witch may have depowered herself, an incident with Hawkeye shows that she may have in fact retained her reality altering powers. Another hint of this, is that Wanda is 1\/3 the earth's High Priestess, As seen in tarot cards. Showing that there is still hope for her after all.<\/p><h2>Personal Data<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7884\/911952-scarlet_witch_litho_by_diablo2003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-911952\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4705882352941\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:147.1%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7884\/911952-scarlet_witch_litho_by_diablo2003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-911952\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7884\/911952-scarlet_witch_litho_by_diablo2003.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7884\/911952-scarlet_witch_litho_by_diablo2003.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><ul><li><b>Height:<\/b> 5' 7\"<\/li><li><b>Weight<\/b>: 132 lbs (60 kg)<\/li><li><b>Eyes<\/b>: Green<\/li><li><b>Hair<\/b>: Brown<\/li><\/ul><h3>Status<\/h3><p style=\"\"><b>Known Relatives:<\/b> Unknown father, <a href=\"\/magda\/4005-45372\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45372\">Magda<\/a> Lehnsherr (mother, deceased), Pietro aka <a href=\"\/quicksilver\/4005-1467\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver<\/a> (twin brother), <a href=\"\/vision\/4005-1504\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">Vision<\/a> (estranged husband), <a href=\"\/django-maximoff\/4005-11506\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11506\">Django Maximoff<\/a> (foster father, deceased), <a href=\"\/marya-maximoff\/4005-11507\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11507\">Marya Maximoff<\/a> (foster mother, deceased), <a href=\"\/crystal\/4005-2115\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\">Crystal<\/a> (sister-in-law), <a href=\"\/luna\/4005-10962\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10962\">Luna<\/a> (niece), <a href=\"\/speed\/4005-40518\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40518\">Tommy<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"\/wiccan\/4005-40505\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40505\">Billy<\/a> (reincarnated sons), Talia Wagner aka <a href=\"\/nocturne\/4005-4565\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4565\">Nocturne<\/a> (alternate reality daughter), unborn twins of <a href=\"\/speed\/4005-40518\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40518\">Tommy<\/a> and <a href=\"\">Kate Bishop<\/a> (alternate reality grandchildren).<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Citizenship:<\/b> Transian (U.S. naturalized)<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Place of Birth:<\/b> <a href=\"\/wundagore-mountain-transia\/4020-41286\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41286\">Wundagore Mountain, Transia<\/a><\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Marital Status:<\/b> Divorced<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Occupations:<\/b> <a href=\"\/avengers\/4060-3806\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avenger<\/a>, adventurer, witchcraft tutor, housewife, former terrorist (with the <a href=\"\/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants\/4060-17652\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17652\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants<\/a>)<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Education:<\/b> Unrevealed<\/p><h2>Alternate Universes<\/h2><h3>Age of Apocalypse (Earth-295)<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10268\/271945-111853-scarlet-witch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-271945\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7475\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10268\/271945-111853-scarlet-witch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-271945\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10268\/271945-111853-scarlet-witch.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10268\/271945-111853-scarlet-witch.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Age of Apocalypse<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In the alternate reality called <a href=\"\/age-of-apocalypse\/4045-40752\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40752\">Age of Apocalypse<\/a>, Wanda's life was short lived.

Mystique is one of the few bisexual characters in comics, having had a long relationship with Irene Adler, otherwise known as <a href=\"\/destiny\/4005-3557\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3557\">Destiny<\/a>. Mystique initially met Destiny when she was hired to help her decipher her dreams and stop the worst of them from coming to pass. The two of them would eventually become life-long lovers. When Mystique was involved with Destiny the two of them actively tried to thwart Destiny's negative precognitive dreams from actually occuring. The relationship lasted decades, ending when Destiny was killed. Mystique has also been the mother of at least three children. She is the biological mother of both <a href=\"\/nightcrawler\/4005-1461\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler<\/a> and <a href=\"\/graydon-creed\/4005-13351\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13351\">Graydon Creed<\/a>, whose father was the mutant <a href=\"\/sabretooth\/4005-4563\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\">Sabretooth<\/a>. Ironically, Graydon turned out to be just a normal human and became the mutant-hating leader of the racist group known as the <a href=\"\/friends-of-humanity\/4060-40563\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40563\">Friends of Humanity<\/a>. He was eventually assassinated by Mystique herself. Her third child, by adoption, was <a href=\"\/rogue\/4005-1446\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue<\/a>, who would eventually join the <a href=\"\/x-men\/4060-3173\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men<\/a> after turning her back on Mystique's <a href=\"\/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants\/4060-17652\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17652\">Brotherhood Of Evil Mutants<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10390\/368433-199928-get-mystique.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-368433\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.53\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10390\/368433-199928-get-mystique.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-368433\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10390\/368433-199928-get-mystique.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Mystique and Wolverine<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In the 1920s, Mystique encountered the Canadian mutant <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/wolverine\/4005-1440\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine<\/a> when he joined her gang of mutant pick-pockets. This meeting was possibly orchestrated by Weapon X. The two became lovers. Wolverine did not act when Mystique let their friends die when the situation turned sour, though he was extremely remorseful. As they ran away, Mystique pushed Wolverine out of the train they were escaping on because she did not trust him.<\/p><p style=\"\">At one point in her life, circumstances led Mystique to an important figure in Wolverine's past, <a href=\"\/sabretooth\/4005-4563\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\">Victor Creed.<\/a> When the two initially met, Mystique was in the guise of Leni Zauber. Both Leni and Victor had been assigned to kill a scientist in Berlin. Although, Mystique was the one who ultimately killed the scientist, the two of them still needed to maintain a low profile and opted to stay in the same safe house. It was here that they first became lovers until Mystique faked her death so that she could leave Sabretooth without objection. During their time together, unbeknownst to Sabretooth, they conceived a child. Mystique immediately gave the child up for adoption, although she still kept track of him until he hit adolescence when it became apparent that he was not a mutant.<\/p><p style=\"\">Later on in Mystique's life she had a son named Kurt Wagner with the ancient biblical mutant named <a href=\"\/azazel\/4005-40526\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40526\">Azazel<\/a>. By this time, Mystique was calling herself Raven Darkholme, possibly her actual name. During this time Raven was married to <a href=\"\/christian-wagner\/4005-57077\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57077\">Christian Wagner<\/a> and the two of them were happily married until she learned of Christian's infertility. She then used her powers to have sex with a number of partners as she desperately wanted another child. That is when she met Azazel, who told her of the islands he ruled off the coast of Bermuda, and that he was the father of many mutants who were called <a href=\"\/neyaphem\/4060-45565\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45565\">Neyaphem<\/a>.

Pressured to have her son, Kurt, blood-tested, Raven killed her father-in-law and buried him. She then gave birth to a baby with black hair, yellow eyes, blue skin, and a pointed tail after reverting to her true form due to the stress of the birth. The villagers thought that both the mother and child were demons and they quickly attempted to kill them. Raven soon threw her newborn son into a river before changing her form to that of a local villager so that she could escape alive. It is later revealed that, either through Destiny's precognitive powers or through the government contacts she eventually cultivates, Mystique keeps tabs on Kurt Wagner's whereabouts; she reveals in her first encounter with Nightcrawler that his foster mother, <a href=\"\/margali-szardos\/4005-23007\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23007\">Margali Szardos<\/a>, is aware of her.<\/p><p style=\"\">Distraught over what she had done, Mystique wandered the world for some time During this time, she met the mutant Destiny and became both friends and lovers with her. Destiny, who was precognitive, told Raven it would be best for her to adopt a certain child named Anna Marie (who would later grow up to become the X-Man known as <a href=\"\/rogue\/4005-1446\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue<\/a>). Wanting to make up for abandoning Graydon and Kurt, Mystique eagerly agreed. Mystique genuinely cared for Anna, and raised her like the child she had lost. Although, initially distrustful, Raven gained the young girl's trust, creating a family with her and Destiny for nearly a decade.. Unfortunately, Destiny aged at the rate of a normal human, while Mystique's powers allowed her to retain her youthful body.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5599\/164961-5437-brotherhood-of-evil.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-164961\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5375\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5599\/164961-5437-brotherhood-of-evil.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-164961\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5599\/164961-5437-brotherhood-of-evil.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5599\/164961-5437-brotherhood-of-evil.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Mystique's Brotherhood<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">While still raising Anna Marie, Raven had concealed her mutant abilities so well that she was able to work for the United States Civil Service and eventually worked her way up to the trusted position of Deputy Director of the Defense Advanced Research Planning Agency (DARPA) in the United States Department of Defense, giving her access to military secrets and advanced weaponry, both of which she used for her own criminal and subversive purposes. In order to help further her terrorist activities, Raven organized a group called the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, whose members consisted of <a href=\"\/avalanche\/4005-3553\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3553\">Avalanche<\/a>, the <a href=\"\/blob\/4005-3182\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3182\">Blob<\/a>, Destiny, and <a href=\"\/pyro\/4005-3554\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3554\">Pyro<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">After training Anna in the use of her powers, Mystique gave her the codename, Rogue, and allowed her to join the Brotherhood. With Rogue on their team, the Brotherhood successfully defeated the <a href=\"\/avengers\/4060-3806\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers<\/a>. However, during their battle, Rogue attempted to use her absorption power on <a href=\"\/ms-marvel\/4005-21561\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Ms. Marvel<\/a>. Unfortunately, Ms. Marvel did not go down easily, and Rogue was forced to absorb her psyche and powers permanently. This caused Rogue to feel as if she was going insane, since Ms. Marvel's persona often attempted to gain control of Rogue's mind.

Unfortunately, Mystique believed that Xavier had brainwashed her daughter and she attempted to liberate Rogue from the X-Men's control. This rescue mission was short lived after Rogue told Mystique that she believed Xavier was the only person in the world who could help her control her powers. Reluctantly, Raven left Rogue with the X-Men, although she still continued to check in on her from time to time. Over the years however, Mystique began to resent Xavier and the X-Men, believing that they had stolen one of the few special people in her life.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Days Of Future Past<\/h3><p style=\"\">Mystique's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants gained infamy after their attempt to assassinate <a href=\"\/robert-kelly\/4005-15026\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15026\">Senator Robert Kelly<\/a>.

She was assisted by Xavier and the X-Men before saving Xavier himself by helping to defeat the Shadow King.

Mystique was eventually saved by <a href=\"\/wolverine\/4005-1440\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine, <\/a>who took her back to the X-Mansion so that she could recover. In the end, Raven had a complete mental breakdown and was taken to Forge's home in Dallas. With Forge, Mystique became horrified when she discovered that her son, Graydon Creed had become the leader of an anti-mutant hate group and had hired Sabretooth to kill Mystique. However, Mystique revealed the truth about their son to Sabretooth, convincing him to go after Graydon instead. Later, when a top ranking U.S. General with ties to Graydon turned up dead, Forge realized that Mystique was to blame and was preparing her next move to kill her son. This led to Rogue and Nightcrawler's interference as they attempted to stop Raven. Nightcrawler also finally learned the truth that Mystique was indeed his mother. Although, Raven failed to kill Creed, she was presumed dead after saving Nightcrawler, when Creed attempted to murder his newly discovered brother. During her time with Forge, the two were also attacked by the time-traveling <a href=\"\/trevor-fitzroy\/4005-8300\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8300\">Trevor Fitzroy<\/a>, but the intercession of the X-Men saved them.<\/p><h3>Legion Quest<\/h3><p style=\"\">Months later, Raven returned and attempted to kill <a href=\"\/legion\/4005-13349\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13349\">Legion, <\/a>who was responsible for Destiny's death on Muir Island. When her attempt failed, Raven began to flee from the government. Unfortunately, Forge had placed a tracking device in her head during their time together, allowing the government team, X-Factor to find and capture her. She was then forced to become a member of X-Factor, after she discovered a government plot to blow up a dam and blame it on mutants. Sabretooth was subsequently placed on the team as a sleeper agent in order to kill Raven. During her time with X-Factor, Mystique began to develop a true romantic relationship with Forge, even though he thought that she was only using him. Later it was discovered that Mystique's lover, Destiny, had given birth to children during one of the couples long separations. The children were now adults with their own children, one of whom was a mutant. Graydon had the mutant teen savagely beaten by members of the Friends of Humanity, as a warning towards his mother. Furious, Mystique began preparations to again attempt to kill her son, however she quickly decided against it when she learned that his own colleagues wanted him killed so that he could be made a martyr. Mystique reluctantly attempted to save Graydon from being assassinated, although she failed, and ultimately ushered in a new wave of anti-mutant violence.<\/p><h3>Operation: Zero Tolerance<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10069\/547578-mystique_00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-547578\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.9029126213592\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:190.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10069\/547578-mystique_00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-547578\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10069\/547578-mystique_00.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10069\/547578-mystique_00.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Search for Legacy Virus<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Soon after, Sabretooth acted on his orders to kill the members of X-Factor after \"<a href=\"\/operation-zero-tolerance\/4045-43899\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43899\">Operation: Zero Tolerance<\/a>\" was initiated. Mystique attacked Sabretooth in time to save her defeated teammates and arranged for them to receive immediate medical attention before going on the run again. Later, Mystique started using the alias of Mallory Brickman, the wife of a US Senator. She then used her husband's status to send the <a href=\"\/fbi\/4060-55443\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55443\">FBI<\/a> after Sabretooth. Weeks later, Mystique infiltrated a government operated building where she attempted to gain critical intel on the identity of those responsible for her son's death and the attempt to kill her via Sabretooth. Nearing success, Mystique suddenly lost her powers and reverted to a human form before being arrested. This ultimately ruined all of Raven's hard work over the years, as the government destroyed all of her established alternate identities and denied her access to any of the money that she and Destiny had accumulated together. Mystique's relationship with Rogue also took a turn for the worse when Rogue refused to break Mystique out of jail and instead decided to join her \"second\" family by assisting the X-Men in defeating the <a href=\"\/high-evolutionary\/4005-13346\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13346\">High Evolutionary<\/a>, who was responsible for the sudden loss of mutant powers. When the X-Men succeed in their mission, all mutants regained their abilities, allowing Mystique to escape from prison. Mystique was soon sent back in time by the original X-Factor's sentient ship where she discovered that her son's killer was none other than herself, and that Destiny was one of the original members of the anti-mutant conspiracy which she had been fighting for countless years now. This caused Mystique to have another mental breakdown and she became obsessed with eradicating humanity.<\/p><h3>Red Data\/Condition Critical<\/h3><p style=\"\">She soon developed a plan and reformed the Brotherhood of Mutants in order to steal the <a href=\"\/legacy-virus\/4015-42281\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42281\">Legacy Virus<\/a> from <a href=\"\/moira-mactaggert\/4005-8304\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\">Moira MacTaggert<\/a>. While impersonating Moira, Mystique's previous experience with bio-terrorism allowed her to use Moira's infected blood to create a weapon that would target humans rather than mutants. Raven was also able to find a cure for the human version of the Legacy Virus before destroying Moira's lab and fatally injuring the scientist. Before leaving Muir Island in the form of Moira, Raven was discovered by <a href=\"\/wolfsbane\/4005-4557\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\">Rahne Sinclaire<\/a>. Raven quickly shot the mutant in the chest with a gun engineered by Forge, depowering the young mutants. Rogue eventually attempted to stop her mother, but Mystique stabbed her in the stomach once she knew that Rogue would not allow her plan to be successful. Rogue survived the attack by absorbing Wolverine's healing factor and claws which she used to brutally stab Mystique in the back. Later in a hospital, Raven confessed to the X-Men that in Destiny's visions, she had seen a dark future for mutants and no matter what preventative action she took, it still seemed to unfold. Without sympathy, Mystique was sent to prison where she eventually escaped and began using <a href=\"\/martinique-jason\/4005-15167\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15167\">Martinique Jason<\/a> to control <a href=\"\/x-corps\/4060-40860\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40860\">X-Corps<\/a> before ruining the organization and cutting <a href=\"\/banshee\/4005-9708\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9708\">Banshee's<\/a> throat, leaving him in critical condition.<\/p><h3>Mystique: Quiet<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/1213506-140377_198577_mike_mayhew.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1213506\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5025\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/1213506-140377_198577_mike_mayhew.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1213506\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6754\/1213506-140377_198577_mike_mayhew.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6754\/1213506-140377_198577_mike_mayhew.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Mystique and Shortpack<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After being defeated again, Mystique attempted to work as a double agent for Xavier, who offered to shield Mystique from being found by the other countries she was now wanted in for her acts of terrorism. However, if she were caught, Xavier would deny ever having worked with her. Mystique was assisted on her missions with advanced technology developed by Forge, and the three inch telepathic mutant, named <a href=\"\/shortpack\/4005-4280\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4280\">Shortpack<\/a>, who acted as her handler. During one of her missions, an enemy of Xavier's known as the <a href=\"\/steinbeck\/4005-4299\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4299\">Quiet Man<\/a>, contacted Mystique and offered to give her an interference transmitter (the same device that Xavier used to keep her hidden from the authorities) on the condition that she kill Xavier. Mystique created a plan with Forge where she would attempt to kill Xavier, however, he would stop her at the last minute so that the Quiet Man believed that she was still working for him. Unfortunately, the X-Men believed that she had truly attempted to kill Xavier and went after her.<\/p><p style=\"\">It was Rogue who eventually managed to track down Mystique and she quickly disowned her foster mother, claiming that she had simply gone too far this time. Mystique attempted to apologize for what she had done to Rogue, however, her efforts were futile as she was forced to blow up the house she was in order to escape from Rogue. Mystique then returned to the Quiet Man to gain the interference transmitter, however, the Quiet Man had already decided to kill Mystique, believing that she had outlived her usefulness. It was here that Mystique learns that the Quiet Man is in reality, Xavier's former special agent that Mystique replaced, <a href=\"\/prudence\/4005-4284\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4284\">Prudence Leighton<\/a>. After an ensuing fight, Mystique managed to kill the Quiet Man, rescue her former handler, Shortpack, and discover that the interference transmitter she gained had been fake all along. She soon attempted to switch Forge's real transmitter with her fake one, however, Forge angrily smashed it before telling Mystique that he never wanted to see her again. The two mutants share a final and sad good-bye kiss before Mystique leaves and Forge discovers that she had already switched his transmitter with the fake one.<\/p><h3>X-Men: Legacy<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/88556-160761-mystique.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-88556\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.55\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/88556-160761-mystique.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-88556\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/88556-160761-mystique.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/88556-160761-mystique.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Mystique as Foxx<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After some time had passed, Mystique began to become worried about Rogue's relationship with <a href=\"\/gambit\/4005-1499\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1499\">Gambit<\/a> and their inability to have a physical relationship. Because of this, Mystique first posed as a student at the Xavier Institute named Foxx and attempted to seduce Gambit. However, her true identity was soon discovered and she claimed that her intention was to simply test Gambit, and was only acting in Rogue's best interest. She then asked to join the team, admitting that the world was too dangerous a place for mutants to be on their own, so she sought asylum with the X-Men. Rogue was opposed to Mystique's membership, however, the team opted to allow her to join on a probationary status.<\/p><p style=\"\">Partly due to her previous interference, Rogue and Gambit soon split up and Mystique attempted to play match maker by introducing Rogue to the mutant known as <a href=\"\/pulse\/4005-15257\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15257\">Pulse<\/a>. This did not work out in Mystique's favor and when Rogue was assembling her strike force of X-Men she added Mystique to her team only to keep an eye on her. Mystique ultimately helped Rogue's X-Men in their missions, including in their battle against the <a href=\"\/children-of-the-vault\/4060-43765\" data-ref-id=\"4060-43765\">Children of the Vault<\/a>. During her time with the X-Men, Mystique developed and consummated a brief relationship with <a href=\"\/iceman\/4005-1464\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman<\/a>. However, she later revealed herself to be a traitor when she allied with <a href=\"\/lady-mastermind\/4005-12055\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12055\">Lady Mastermind<\/a> and <a href=\"\/omega-sentinel\/4005-3421\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3421\">Omega Sentinel<\/a> (who was being possessed by <a href=\"\/malice\/4005-11877\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11877\">Malice<\/a>) and defected with them to join Mr. Sinister's <a href=\"\/marauders\/4060-40480\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40480\">Marauders<\/a> during their attack on the X-Men. At the peak of the battle Mystique shot Rogue and subsequently abducted her, taking her to the Marauders base before giving <a href=\"\/iceman\/4005-1464\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman<\/a> a brief warning about the future.<\/p><h3>Messiah Complex<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/27836\/556115-its_not_mine.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-556115\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1269035532995\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:112.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/27836\/556115-its_not_mine.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-556115\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/27836\/556115-its_not_mine.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/27836\/556115-its_not_mine.png\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Mystique with the Messiah baby.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Mystique stayed with the Marauders and looked after the still injured Rogue. When Gambit and the other Marauders returned to their base on Muir Island with the <a href=\"\/baby-mutant\/4005-49329\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49329\">Baby Mutant<\/a>, they immediately hand the child to Mr. Sinister. Sinister then tells the Marauders to leave, with the exception of Gambit, when Sinister shapeshifts into Mystique and it is revealed that she has already killed <a href=\"\/mr-sinister\/4005-3179\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\">Mr. Sinister<\/a> after she forced him to touch Rogue's skin. She then admits that everything that she has done since joining the X-Men has been done in order to save Rogue's life after reading certain sections of <a href=\"\/destinys-diaries\/4055-44250\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44250\">Destiny's Diaries<\/a>, which revealed the outcome of the actions that Mystique should take. Mystique then tells Gambit that the child is required to save Rogue's life. Gambit does not understand the connection until Mystique places the child's forehead onto Rogue's lips. Gambit quickly snatches the child away and chastises Mystique, claiming that Rogue would not want to sacrifice the life of an innocent child only to save hers. Gambit soon realizes that the child is still alive, however, Mystique suddenly begins to breakdown when Rogue does not instantly wake up. Professor Xavier soon walks into the room and Gambit gives him the child for safe keeping as Rogue begins to gain consciousness. Gambit quickly tries to explain the situation, however, Rogue is still furious at her mother, and simply says that all of it has to stop. Rogue attempts to kill Mystique by touching her, believing that she is still infected by Strain-88, however it is revealed that Rogue has been completely healed and no longer has the psyche of every being she has touched residing within her. Unfortunately for her, this doesn't last long as Mystique's psychic imprint now resides within her. Rogue then leaves Mystique unconscious and heads to the Australian outback to work things out for herself.<\/p><h3>Get Mystique<\/h3><p style=\"\">During the following commotion of the end battle and shooting of Xavier in <i>Messiah Complex<\/i>, Mystique regains consciousness and escapes from the area. <a href=\"\/cyclops\/4005-1459\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops<\/a> later asked Wolverine to track down Mystique and permanently take her out. Wolverine tracks her first to Iran, then to <a href=\"\/afghanistan\/4020-55914\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55914\">Afghanistan<\/a>, all the while remembering the first time they met. It turns out that both of them had previously been captured for being mutants in Mexico in 1921, and after freeing themselves, Mystique convinced Wolverine to join her group of fellow mutants in Kansas City. Wolverine agrees, however, he double crosses the group when they attempt to rob a bank by leading police to the scene. Fortunately for Mystique, she had already left before the police arrived. During the present time, Wolverine continued to track Mystique before he is ambushed. Mystique then shapeshifts into his form and proceeds to kill an unknown Afghan woman. When Wolverine finally arrives at the scene, others begin to shoot at him, allowing Mystique to escape. Later, she impersonates a nun in Baghdad, where Wolverine tracks her to a bar. After learning why Wolverine is chasing her, she escapes to another part of Iraq. She shapeshifts into the Iraqi mistress of <a href=\"\/senator-miles-brickman\/4005-2278\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2278\">Senator Miles Brickman<\/a> , allowing her to kill and impersonate her former husband when he comes to visit. Wolverine finds a way to get into the military base to get close to Mystique in her Brickman disguise. When he finds her in Brickman's quarters, Wolverine calls Mystique a coward, and goads her into a fight, but she escapes yet again. Later on Wolverine tracks Mystique into the desert, and she is naked to show Wolverine that she is not a coward nor is she ashamed of herself. After some explosions and shooting, Wolverine finally gets closer to her and a fight ensues. Mystique tells him that the X-Men kept accepting her into the group only for her to betray them. She tells them that it is only her nature and that Wolverine will also betray them sooner or later. Wolverine is shot and stabbed while Mystique is stabbed with his claws multiple times. Injured, Mystique shoots Wolverine in the head which should cause him temporary brain damage as she then throws up in his face. She crawls away until Wolverine heals and awakens only to find her yet again. She tells him to just kill her but he sees that she is bleeding to death and throws her a gun, telling her that he has friends who will always come to get him, while she's alone. With that in mind, she should know what the gun is for. Mystique screams at Logan as he leaves her in the desert with the pistol.<\/p><h3>Manifest Destiny<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/1213500-537733_x_men_manifest_destiny_20080901011524705.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1213500\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.43944636678201\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:43.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/1213500-537733_x_men_manifest_destiny_20080901011524705.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1213500\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6754\/1213500-537733_x_men_manifest_destiny_20080901011524705.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6754\/1213500-537733_x_men_manifest_destiny_20080901011524705.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Manifest Destiny<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">It is later discovered that Mystique survived that day and has been in the form of Iceman's ex-girlfriend, <a href=\"\/opal-tanaka\/4005-11577\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11577\">Opal Tanaka<\/a>, having met Bobby at a party. Recently, Bobby had been experiencing difficulties with his powers. His body is in pain and always feels cold. As Opal, Mystique encourages him to call Hank. Hank advises Bobby that the problem with his powers could very well be due to the toxin Mystique slipped him, but he would need to run tests in San Fransisco to be sure. He sends the X-Jet by remote and 'Opal' insists on coming with him. During the flight she questions him about how he was infected and asks Bobby, \"I wonder if she meant for this to happen\", but he dismisses the idea that Mystique would even care. Soon after, the bomb she slipped onto the plane explodes, creating a hole in the side of the jet. She reverts back to her true form before kicking him out of the jet and to the snowy covered mountains they were flying over.<\/p><p style=\"\">Throughout the next few days Mystique repeatedly attacks him and nearly kills him; but never finishing him off. She tells Iceman that she has never loved nor liked him. She injects him directly with another toxin, refusing to let hospital workers help him, and forcing him to cure himself with his malfunctioning powers. While Bobby hitchhiked, she attacked the semi he was riding in. Bobby traps her in ice, but she escapes when he is distracted by the semi's driver.<\/p><p style=\"\">She is later found waiting on top of the Golden Gate Bridge, disguised as Iceman, with a pressure switch detonator in her hand to the bomb she has planted. Bobby is given permission to approach her first while the others look for the bomb. It's here the two finally have it out. He tells her that Wolverine told him what happened in their fight. Mystique admits that Logan was right about her being alone. That it sounded like the truth. Bobby tells her that he thinks she was lying earlier about not loving him. To this she has no reply. He pushes her further about how her daughter and son won't have anything to do with her. She starts to cry and demands he stop, but he just pushes harder telling her that if she would try asking someone out to dinner in place of blowing up bridges she might actually get somewhere. With her hurt, angry, and sad she is distracted enough to let Bobby freeze her hand while still holding the detonator. Her bomb has been found and the rest of the X-Men are on the way. She uses her frozen fits to knock Bobby down and tells him, she will come to see him again. Not with her body or face, but promises that he will love her. That being said, she jumps off the top of the bridge, the full seven-hundred feet; and into the San Francisco Bay. Her body is never found, but Bobby is sure she is alive and realizes he owes her thanks. In her own way she cured him of the very problem she started.<\/p><h3>Utopia<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7884\/1035301-98_percent_cacao_x_men_by_mikechoi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1035301\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2865275142315\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7884\/1035301-98_percent_cacao_x_men_by_mikechoi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1035301\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/7884\/1035301-98_percent_cacao_x_men_by_mikechoi.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/7884\/1035301-98_percent_cacao_x_men_by_mikechoi.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Norman Osborn &amp; his Dark X-Men<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After birth control policies are proposed for mutants in order to regulate their numbers, <a href=\"\/norman-osborn\/4005-58812\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn<\/a>, then the <a href=\"\/norman-osborn\/4005-58812\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Iron Patriot<\/a>, as well as the director of <a href=\"\/hammer\/4060-56065\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56065\">HAMMER<\/a>, organizes his own mutant peace-keeping team: The <a href=\"\/dark-x-men\/4060-56445\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56445\">Dark X-Men<\/a>.

Meanwhile, on Genosha a large contingent of heroes pulled from the ranks of the Avengers, the Inhumans, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men arrived to battle the Onslaught. While Quentin Quire shielded their minds against the Onslaught's attacks, they battled. The Onslaught activated to specially crafted sentinels that were made by Tony Stark with the specific purpose of taking down heroes. With these at his command, the heroes fell, one-by-one, until Magneto fled the island, leaving Iron Man alone against his creations. When Magneto left, he decided to pull together a group of his own. Instead of contacting heroes, he called together a group of the most heinous villains: <a href=\"\/loki\/4005-4324\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki Laufeyson<\/a>, <a href=\"\/doctor-doom\/4005-1468\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom<\/a>, <a href=\"\/enchantress\/4005-7225\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7225\">Enchantress<\/a>, <a href=\"\/hobgoblin-kingsley\/4005-7605\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7605\">Hobgoblin<\/a>, <a href=\"\/jack-olantern\/4005-40901\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40901\">Jack O'Lantern<\/a>, <a href=\"\/carnage\/4005-1490\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1490\">Carnage<\/a>, <a href=\"\/deadpool\/4005-7606\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool<\/a>, <a href=\"\/sabretooth\/4005-4563\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\">Sabretooth <\/a>and Mystique. Together, Magneto's Cabal tore through the sentinels, which were unprepared to battle villains. However, they soon fell prey to the Onslaught's mind manipulation. Mystique and the others bought the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom just enough time to cast an Inversion Spell. The spell transformed the Red Onslaught back into the Red Skull, but it also affected the other heroes and villains present on the island - including Mystique. Many of the heroes began to turn colder, and more villainous, while many of the villains began to see the error of their ways. The heroes and villains left the island.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4270568-tp2_7_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4270568\" data-ratio=\"0.71663244353183\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4270568-tp2_7_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4270568\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11119\/111191377\/4270568-tp2_7_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11119\/111191377\/4270568-tp2_7_copy.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Sabretooth Saves Mystique<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Evan Sabahnur, once a sweet and kind young boy, had been inverted, transforming into the Apocalypse. As such, he desired to end all of humankind. This time, he had the full support of the X-Men, who vowed to never again allow the humans and the Avengers to put them down. Now inverted, Mystique decided to confront Apocalypse, who sent Rogue and Nightcrawler to meet her. Mystique urged her children to stop their lunacy at once, but they wouldn't listen. They attacked and attempted to kill Mystique, who was saved by an inverted Sabretooth. The pair was then whisked away to join the latest incarnation of the Avengers, which included all the villains present on Genosha, as well as Steve Rogers, Spider-Man, Zenpool (Deadpool, inverted) and Nomad. In a last ditch attempt to stop Apocalypse from detonating a gene bomb that would wipe out humanity, these new Avengers battled Apocalypse and the X-Men one last time.<\/p><h2>Powers<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/297697-169684-mystique.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-297697\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.8925\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/297697-169684-mystique.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-297697\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/77\/297697-169684-mystique.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/77\/297697-169684-mystique.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Partial Transformation<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Mystique is a <a href=\"\/mutant\/4015-40656\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">mutant<\/a> metamorph who can psionically shift the cells and tissues of her body so as to change her physical appearance. She can cause herself to look and sound exactly like any human, humanoid, or semi-humanoid being of either sex, wearing virtually any kind of clothing and accessory (even glasses). As such, she almost never wears clothes of her own since she prefers to mimic clothing. Her control is so exact that she can precisely duplicate another person's retina pattern in her own eyes, finger, palm and skin-pore patterns on her own hands and skin, and vocal cords to match voices to the point of deceiving vocal recognition software. She is also able to shift the placement of vital organs in her body to avoid damage from lacerations and punctures (notably gunfire). She also possesses a retarded aging process, if she ages at all; she is over 100 years old. As a result of exposure to unknown extraterrestrial radiation her abilities enhanced; She now possesses a healing factor (which grants her a great tolerance for toxins), enhanced strength, and augmented shapeshifting powers. She has been shown growing wings (enabling flight), shifting her abdomen to conceal small firearms, growing extra limbs, changing her mass to become a small child and flattening her body (strikingly similar to <a href=\"\/mr-fantastic\/4005-2151\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic<\/a>).<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/308\/186380-72319-mystique.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-186380\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/308\/186380-72319-mystique.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-186380\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/308\/186380-72319-mystique.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/308\/186380-72319-mystique.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>New Shapeshifting Powers<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Mystique was limited only by her inability to diminish or increase her own mass. As a result, while she could make herself look exactly like a person who was physically bigger than herself, she would not weigh as much as the actual person that she was imitating. Although she could maintain the form of another person of similar height, weight, and build indefinitely (as with her own appearance as Raven Darkholme), the longer she maintained that form, the greater the strain she felt. If she maintained a bigger form for too long a period, the length of which is directly proportional to the difference in size between that form and her normal one, she would collapse and revert to her normal appearance. However recently she has stated that her mass can change when she does, possibly a result of her enhancement.<\/p><p style=\"\">Mystique also cannot duplicate the powers of the person she imitates: for example, when she turned herself into a duplicate of Nightcrawler, she did not gain his ability to teleport. As of yet Mystique has not demonstrated any ability to adopt the form of non-humanoid beings, animals, plants, or non-living objects, it is conjectured that she cannot imitate any of these without interfering with the proper functioning of her internal organs and possibly causing her death.

When she regains her senses, she traps the squad heroes in a force field as Doom arrives. however, the villainess Screaming Mimi was really the SHIELD agent Songbird in disguise and helped free the heroes. Mystique was then arrested by SHIELD and has not been seen in season one since. While disguised as Black Widow, nearly all the squad members were showing romantic feelings for her, giving her a multitude of chocolates and flowers and Tony even asking her out to an Italian restaurant. During her fight with Tony, she did reveal she likes Italian food. Her appearance is her comic book form, although a more cartoony style to match the rest of the series. Also in this episode, she takes on the forms of Iron Man (complete with his suit's features), Falcon, Silver Surfer (complete with the board, although unable to stand on it), Thor, Captain America, and even Hulk (although this made her seriously clumsy due to not being used to Hulk's size and weight, although Wolverine jokes the stumbling is an improvement).

In a surprise move, Mystique rescues Nixon and shoots Magneto on national television, and after an emotionally intense standoff, is persuaded by Charles to spare Trask's life. This results in the timeline being drastically changed, and the apocalyptic future Wolverine hailed from being erased.

Bobby was able to convince Lorna to come with him to his apartment. When Lorna finally meets the X-Men, they all discover that she is actually a mutant with latent powers. Mesmero would come and kidnap her, bringing her to his headquarters. He put her in a \u201cgenetic stimulator\u201d that activated her latent mutant abilities. The X-Men would try and save her and Magneto was revealed to be the the mastermind behind the whole thing. He also reveals that he is the father of Lorna. This caused Lorna to hesitate when an opportunity to kill him presented itself. However, Iceman would be able to convince Lorna that Magneto is not really her father when he brings up evidence that her parents died in a plane crash. Lorna then defeated Magneto, who would later be revealed as an android. Lorna would join the X-Men and would pick up the code name Magnetrix, however she did not like it and decided to get rid of it.<\/p><h3>Captured by the Sentinels<\/h3><p style=\"\">Lorna was captured by Sentinels when she moved to Manhattan, and she was so shocked that she didn't have a chance to use her powers. In the Sentinel's base, she met <a href=\"\/havok\/4005-3546\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\">Havok<\/a>, the younger brother of Cyclops, and the two got along pretty well. Unfortunately, <a href=\"\/larry-trask\/4005-10255\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10255\">Larry Trask<\/a>, who was controlling the Sentinels, used this to his advantage and threatened Lorna to get Havok to do what he wanted. After the X-Men saved Havok and Lorna, she decided to join the X-Men since she was sick of being a victim and sitting on the sidelines. Also, she was growing attracted to Havok. This strongly annoyed Iceman, since he had introduced Lorna to the X-Men and felt he had the rights to pursue a relationship with Lorna first. Since Alex and Lorna didn't have full control over their powers yet, they were often given easier missions or left out completely.<\/p><h3>Becoming Polaris<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/170\/76651-115691-polaris.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-76651\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"3.2\" data-width=\"125\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 125px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:320.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/170\/76651-115691-polaris.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-76651\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/170\/76651-115691-polaris.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/170\/76651-115691-polaris.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Polaris<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">When the senior X-Men had trouble in the <a href=\"\/savage-land\/4020-21766\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land<\/a>, Professor X sent Havok and Lorna to help them. During their introduction to Ka-Zar, Lorna realized that she didn't have a codename, and came up with \"Magnetrix\". However, she didn't really like it so stopped using it after a very short while. After the adventure in the Savage Land, the X-Men encountered a group who called themselves the Promise, who waited for the final confrontation between humans and mutants and only stepped out of their cryogenic chambers once every 10 years. During one point when they stepped out, they took control of Lorna and Havok, since they hadn't been X-Men for as long of the rest of the team. Under the control of the Promise, Lorna first used her abilities to fly. Luckily, Havok and Lorna were freed by a member of the Promise who didn't agree with the leader, and prevented the leader from putting Havok and Lorna in a cryogenic chamber.<\/p><p style=\"\">A bit later, Havok quit the X-Men after a fight with Iceman over Lorna, and didn't return. Professor X sent Lorna to go find him, and ask him to come back. Whilst in the south-western deserts, Lorna was mistaken by the <a href=\"\/hulk\/4005-2267\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk<\/a> for his former lover, Jarella, due to her green hair. The Hulk grew confused and angry, and was ready to attack Lorna when Havok appeared and managed to use his powers at a skill level he hadn't had before. Havok realized that he had a good chance at being a hero, so decided to rejoin the X-Men. On the way back home, Lorna and Havok were captured by the Secret Empire. The X-Men did not go to find out why Lorna and Havok hadn't returned, assuming that they wanted to be alone together and not rejoin the X-Men. After some time, they realized that there must be something wrong and managed to find and save Lorna and Havok with help from Captain America.<\/p><p style=\"\">The first time Lorna was able to display parts of her fullest potential, it was when the X-Men were kidnapped on Krakoa and a new team was sent to rescue them. She was able to disrupt the Earth\u2019s magnetic forces and throw Krakoa into space. Iceman would eventually develop a crush on Lorna, however Lorna did not have the same feelings for Iceman. She ended up falling in love with Alex Summers (Havok). The two of them decided to leave the X-Men because they did not like risking their lives. They decided to pursue their love for geophysics and moved to the Diablo mountain range in California.<\/p><p style=\"\">Lorna would soon be under the mind control of a Shi'ar agent named <a href=\"\/eric-the-red\/4005-13360\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13360\">Davan Shakari<\/a> who worked for D\u2019Ken when he was emperor of the Shi\u2019ar Galaxy. Shakari is the one who dubbed Lorna \u201cPolaris\u201d and first gave her her purple costume which was a big departure from her original flowing green one (which she now wears a variation of again). Shakari would next kidnap Alex and put him under mind control also. They used them to turn on the X-Men and try to assassinate Professor X. The two of them would battle the X-Men at Kennedy International Airport. Lorna would soon be defeated by Storm and Professor Xavier was be able to free them from Shakari\u2019s control.<\/p><h3>A \"Normal\" Life<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/170\/76652-184556-polaris.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-76652\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.9047619047619\" data-width=\"210\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 210px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:190.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/170\/76652-184556-polaris.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-76652\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/170\/76652-184556-polaris.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/170\/76652-184556-polaris.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Possessed by Malice<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Lorna and Alex would remain as civilians for a long time, but they would also assisting the <a href=\"..\/..\/x-men\/65-3173\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men<\/a> on occasion.

During the battle against <a href=\"..\/..\/apocalypse\/29-7612\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse<\/a>, Lorna was able to assist Magneto and hide the fact that his powers had been reduced. The two then went to the island nation of <a href=\"..\/..\/genosha\/34-40967\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genosha<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"..\/..\/genosha\/34-40967\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genosha<\/a> was a nation that enslaved mutants, and Magneto took it upon himself to overthrow the government with Lorna's help. She agreed because she liked the training <a href=\"..\/..\/magneto\/29-1441\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magneto<\/a> gave her in return for her help. She began to gain more knowledge in accessing her full potential. When <a href=\"..\/..\/magneto\/29-1441\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magneto<\/a> decided to use Lorna's powers to wipe out the last city that was not under his control she decided to try to stop him from using technology to restore his damaged x-gene, but was defeated by him. Lorna left only to return later to help the Genoshan people. The island of Genosha was then attacked by the mutant hunting robots known as <a href=\"..\/..\/sentinels\/65-4296\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sentinels<\/a>. Lorna was one of the few survivors but left scarred because was not able to stop the robot and sat there witnessing the murder of millions of mutants. When Magneto recorded the thoughts of the entire population's final moments as digital signals in a black box, Lorna became \"possessed\" by the \"ghosts\" of <a href=\"..\/..\/genosha\/34-40967\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genosha<\/a>. She then constructed a monument in honor of Magneto. The <a href=\"..\/..\/x-men\/65-3173\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men<\/a> would go to Genosha to aid anyone that survived, upon their arrival they discover Lorna walking around naked and weak.<\/p><h3>X-Men<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29650\/877359-new_15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-877359\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.88163265306122\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29650\/877359-new_15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-877359\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/29650\/877359-new_15.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/29650\/877359-new_15.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Back with the X-Men<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After Alex was found in a coma, Lorna returned to the <a href=\"..\/..\/x-men\/65-3173\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men<\/a>. Her attitude had changed, becoming more dark and violent. This all had to do with the traumatic events she witnessed in Genosha, being one of the only survivors after the Sentinel attack by Cassandra Nova. Even her impending marriage to Alex failed to change her behavior. She uncharacteristically killed some mutant-killing soldiers. This resulted in Alex breaking up with Lorna right before their wedding for the X-Men\u2019s personal nurse <a href=\"..\/..\/annie-ghazikhanian\/29-4564\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Annie Ghazikhanian<\/a>. Traumatized and humiliated, the unstable Polaris went berserk and commenced to go on a rampage that nearly resulted in her killing Alex. <a href=\"..\/..\/juggernaut\/29-1445\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Juggernaut<\/a> stopped Lorna by knocking her out. <a href=\"..\/..\/professor-x\/29-1505\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor Xavier<\/a> helped Lorna through psychic therapy.<\/p><p style=\"\">Through the course of the Professor's therapy, it was revealed that Lorna had learned that she was the biological daughter of Magneto during her time in Genosha. Her uncharacteristic behavior was also discovered to be a reaction to witnessing the genocide on Genosha. After the session, Lorna promised to stop her violent rampage and return to the <a href=\"..\/..\/x-men\/65-3173\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men.<\/a> Iceman later admitted to Polaris that he still had feelings for her and after some mild flirtation, the two began a relationship. The relationship was not to last, however, since Lorna's other relationships (namely with Havok) were still unresolved. Havok has confessed to still loving her after Annie had left him, however, Polaris pushed him away.<\/p><h3>M-Day<\/h3><p style=\"\">After the events of \"M-Day,\" in which the majority of mutants lost their powers, Lorna also lost her mutant gene and her magnetic powers. Lorna attempted to hide her loss from her fellow teammates fearing she would be kicked off the team. She was confronted by Valerie Cooper who knew Lorna had lost her powers, but Lorna would claim that it was a psychological problem that was preventing her from accessing them. When she was nearly killed because she could not access her powers, Lorna finally admitted that she lost them. She ended up leaving with Alex watching over her. During her journey, Lorna was kidnapped by an alien named Doop who crashed on Earth, who was also a creature that Lorna saw in space on an earlier mission.<\/p><p style=\"\">Lorna soon was kidnapped by <a href=\"..\/..\/apocalypse\/29-7612\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse<\/a> and transformed into one of his <a href=\"..\/..\/horsemen-of-apocalypse\/65-40423\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Horsemen of Apocalypse<\/a> known as Pestilence. Lorna had the ability to ingest and create new plagues. <a href=\"..\/..\/apocalypse\/29-7612\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse<\/a> also used his advanced technology to give Lorna back a magnetic power similar to the powers she lost on <a href=\"..\/..\/m-day\/12-41003\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-Day<\/a>. While under his influence and brainwashed, Lorna infiltrated the World Health Organization and took the viruses there to create a meta-plague. <a href=\"..\/..\/apocalypse\/29-7612\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse<\/a> had planned to infect all of humanity so that he could offer a cure to only 10% of the population.<\/p><p style=\"\">They would battle the <a href=\"..\/..\/x-men\/65-3173\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/new-avengers\/65-42520\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Avengers<\/a> when they finally discover Pestilence was actually Lorna. Lorna would be able to resist Apocalypse and would later recover in the <a href=\"..\/..\/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning\/34-41138\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning<\/a>. <a href=\"..\/..\/gambit\/29-1499\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gambit<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/sunfire\/29-3175\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunfire<\/a> would return to the X-Mansion and try to recover Lorna, but they battled the <a href=\"..\/..\/x-men\/65-3173\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men<\/a> and failed. Lorna would leave the mansion that night to search for <a href=\"..\/..\/apocalypse\/29-7612\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse<\/a> in Egypt and would eventually be rescued by <a href=\"..\/..\/havok\/29-3546\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Havok<\/a> and the <a href=\"..\/..\/x-men\/65-3173\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men<\/a>. It is unknown why <a href=\"..\/..\/apocalypse\/29-7612\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse<\/a> gave Lorna back her magnetic abilities, as they weren't a part of his plans before being thwarted by the <a href=\"..\/..\/x-men\/65-3173\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Starjammers<\/h3><p style=\"\">Recently the <a href=\"..\/..\/x-men\/65-3173\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men<\/a> learned that the \"all-new all-different X-Men\" that were recruited and sent to Krakoa were not Xavier's first rescue attempt. Only one of the members of the original rescue team, <a href=\"..\/..\/vulcan\/29-21233\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vulcan<\/a>, had survived. Lorna has rejoined the <a href=\"..\/..\/x-men\/65-3173\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men<\/a> and accompanying <a href=\"..\/..\/professor-x\/29-1505\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor Xavier<\/a> and his team of Uncanny X-Men to find and stop Vulcan after Vulcan set off into space for Shi'ar space with the intention of single-handedly bringing down the Shi'ar empire. On rout to the center of the Shi'ar empire Lorna and Havok have been rekindling some of their relationship. Lorna has also been working on learning how to control her new magnetic powers that mimic her old powers using technology.<\/p><p style=\"\">Polaris seems to have gotten in touch with her powers and she began to wield them like her old ones she could control the energies of the others on board their ship when Vulcan crushed the star gates to prevent them form fallowing him. During a huge fight with <a href=\"..\/..\/vulcan\/29-21233\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vulcan<\/a> and the royal guard she managed to display her former power level by stopping even the almost unstoppable <a href=\"..\/..\/gladiator\/29-4653\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gladiator<\/a> for a moment. When Vulcan began to beat Havok it was Polaris who stopped him by attacking his bloodstream she fought him to the point where he was near death and spitting out blood plus his powers weakened. She would have killed him if Deathbird hadn't attack her letting Havok fight Vulcan again on a fair level and he too almost killed Vulcan and left him even weaker.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/239251-194230-polaris.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-239251\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3542857142857\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:135.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/239251-194230-polaris.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-239251\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6754\/239251-194230-polaris.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6754\/239251-194230-polaris.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Polaris<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">This however didn't stop Vulcan from killing his father Corsair with a powerful blast of energy and the fight began to rage out of control so Lilandra sent half the team home against their will and Vulcan left with Deathbird to heal form his wounds. Polaris along with Marvel Girl, Havok, and Korvus stayed with the remaining Starjammers to fight Vulcan and restore Lilandra to the throne. During this time, Lorna acted both as Alex's lover and second-in-command of the team. While their early efforts at destabilizing Vulcan's rule were highly successful, partially due to the hatred of his own subjects towards him, the rebellion was forced to ally with the tyrant when a merciless alien force calling themselves the \"Scy'ar Tal\" assaulted the Shi'ar world of Feather's Edge. Claiming vengeance for a Shi'ar attack that had killed many of their people centuries ago, the Scy'ar Tal destroyed the planet using a massive super weapon called Finality, before declaring their intention to recapture their former home planet, the World, home of the M'Kraan Crystal. While the two sides allied with each other and successfully defeated the menace, Polaris and the rest of the Starjammers were eventually betrayed and captured by Vulcan's forces. As the insane mutant solidifies his grip on power, Polaris and the Starjammers are now his prisoners, cut off from the X-Men and any hope of rescue.<\/p><p style=\"\">Polaris is held under constant sedation while imprisoned, due to the Shi'ar's inability to deal with her powers. With the help of Lilandra, Lorna and the other prisoners are eventually freed. She and the Starjammers escape to Kree-space, where Lorna discovers that her sister-in-law and good friend, Crystal, is being wed to Ronan the Accuser, a move meant to solidify ties between the Inhumans and the Kree. When the wedding is disrupted by the invading Shi'ar, and Lilandra captured, Lorna participates in a rescue attempt which concludes with them freeing Lilandra and bringing the powerful Gladiator to their side.<\/p><p style=\"\">As the war between Kree and Shi'ar escalates, Polaris and the Starjammers participate in an attempted political coup by Lilandra on the throne world of Chandrilar. She is a horrified witness when Lilandra is killed in the ensuing chaos. While in battle during the War of Kings, Korvus and Rachel Summers lose their connection with the Phoenix Force along with all others host of it. Briefly after this the Starjammers head back for Earth after Rogue, Gambit and Magneto come to their aid.<\/p><h3>Return to X-Factor<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/51394\/2124338-x_factor_233_by_davidyardin_d4j0xo4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2124338\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5178571428571\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/51394\/2124338-x_factor_233_by_davidyardin_d4j0xo4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2124338\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/51394\/2124338-x_factor_233_by_davidyardin_d4j0xo4.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/51394\/2124338-x_factor_233_by_davidyardin_d4j0xo4.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>By David Yardin<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Following her return from space and the X-Men events <a href=\"\/schism\/4045-56404\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56404\">Schism<\/a> and <a href=\"\/regenesis\/4045-56644\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56644\">Regenesis<\/a>, Rachel, Alex and Lorna sided with Wolverine.

She and Havok came to lead and to keep the team together. It was during this time she learned of the true reason behind the death of her parents, causing her to once again become severely unstable.

Georgia joined Lorna's team after they battled her father, <a href=\"\/memento-mori\/4005-103568\" data-ref-id=\"4005-103568\">Memento Mori<\/a>. Luna returned to Earth to visit her father, Pietro, after the press conference the team held in which Pietro admitted to the sins of his past. At first, the team was a bit dysfunctional, but since its inception, Lorna has proven to be a very capable and very worthy leader. She was approached by her half-sister, <a href=\"\/scarlet-witch\/4005-1466\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Wanda Maximoff<\/a>, who expressed interest in \"hanging out\".

They acted as a response unit, preventing \"World War Hate\" from escalating. Lorna used her abilities to lift a large well of water - the White House's Reflecting Pool - which was large enough to put out the fire that was consuming the property in and around the White House. The team used implants given to them by fellow teammate Warlock to prevent the Red Onslaught's hatred from affecting them. Gambit's was damaged when he used his powers, and he began to attack Lorna, and steadily gained the upper hand because Lorna was trying not to hurt him. Warlock reinserted the implant, while Danger continued to battle the crazed mobs. Meanwhile, Doug was attempting to protect Georgia and Luna who had decided to leave Serval to help calm things down. Luna used her powers to calm down the people who had been affected, while Georgia drained the nearest attackers of a good portion of their body's moisture, incapacitating them. Quicksilver had been busy stealing the \"football\" from the President of the United States. The \"football\" was, of course, the platform from which the country's nuclear missiles could be accessed. Pietro stole it, and hurried it away to Serval for protection, so that the President, in his altered state of mind, wouldn't do anything rash. He returned just in time to prevent Luna from being pierced by bullets. He whisked her away to safety, ordering Doug to take Luna and Georgia back to Serval. The latter declared that she wanted a uniform. After realizing that they weren't making much of a dent, Lorna and the team pulled out and headed back to Serval, where the company's shields had been keeping \"World War Hate\" at bay. However, a group of sentinels had soon amassed outside the shield.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p style=\"\">Polaris once possessed the natural ability to manipulate magnetism.

Moreover, she could not summon as great an amount of energy as Magneto could. The exact limits on the amount weight that she can magnetically lift at present have not been measured, but they are considerably below those of Magneto. Since she has preferred not to use her powers in combat situations, she has not worked nearly as hard to develop them as Magneto has. As with Magneto, it is unknown whether Polaris's powers were purely psionic or whether they derive from her physically.<\/p><p style=\"\">Polaris had been observed levitating metallic objects and creating force fields in which she can suspend persons or objects in the air and in which she can protect them from attacks from outside the fields. She could also overload or short-circuit electrical systems. By concentrating, Polaris could perceive the world around herself solely as patterns of magnetic and electrical energy. She could perceive the natural magnetic auras surrounding living beings, as well.<\/p><p style=\"\">At one time, when her magnetic powers were just temporarily inaccessible, Lorna possessed the ability to sense and feed off of negative emotions. She could then transduce those emotions into raw physical powers of strength, durability, and stamina.<\/p><p style=\"\">She was de-powered by <a href=\"..\/..\/scarlet-witch\/29-1466\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">her half-siste<\/a>r after M-Day, but almost immediately thereafter she was re-powered by Apocalypse when she was made into a horseman. As his horseman, Lorna could assimilate and release all forms of disease and sickness. She was then cured of the plagues which she ingested as Pestilence, and in that respect seems to be back to normal. It was then revealed that Apocalypse repowered her using Celestial tech and she again can manipulate electromagnetism. Polaris was confirmed to have her X-Gene restored in X-Men Legacy #259.<\/p><p style=\"\">Polaris has stated that these new powers are more difficult to control compared to when she was a mutant and far more dangerous. It has also been said by Emma Frost, that her powers are apparently mutating.<\/p><p style=\"\">Polaris also has green hair due to her x-gene. She still has green hair now because like many other mutants she keep her physical mutation after m-day.<\/p><h3>Power Controversy<\/h3><p style=\"\"><i><b>Reader Submitted Question:<\/b> In War of Kings #2 it is stated that Polaris is a mutant again, but before that it was unclear how the Celestial technology was repowering her. I was wondering what depowered mutants who have been repowered various ways are currently mutants again?<\/i><\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Marvel editor Tom Brevoort:<\/b> <i>I don't think this is a simply binary question--it'll be different in every case. It's still not been made clear precisely what the Celestial tech did to Polaris, and whether that amounts to reactivating her X-gene and returning her powers to her, or finding other ways of giving her similar abilities. And I'd think this would be different for any other character who might have gotten their powers restored through some other means (such as the return of Quicksilver's speed.)<\/i><\/p><p style=\"\"><i>In short, I don't have a clear answer for you on this one.<\/i><\/p><p style=\"\">http:\/\/marvel.com\/blogs\/Tom_Brevoort\/entry\/1487<\/p><p style=\"\">Clarification: Polaris was confirmed to have her X-Gene restored in X-Men Legacy #259.<\/p><h2>Characteristics<\/h2><ul><li><b>Gender:<\/b> Female<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Height:<\/b> 5' 7\"<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Weight:<\/b> 115 lbs<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Eyes:<\/b> Green<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Hair:<\/b> Green<\/li><\/ul><h2>Status<\/h2><ul><li><b>Known Relatives:<\/b> <a href=\"..\/..\/magneto\/29-1441\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Max Eisenhardt<\/a> (Magneto, Father); Suzanna (mother, deceased); Arnold (stepfather, deceased); <a href=\"..\/..\/anya\/29-45373\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anya<\/a> (half-sister, deceased); Mr. Dane (adoptive father); Mrs. Dane (adoptive mother); <a href=\"..\/..\/zaladane\/29-21948\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zaladane<\/a> (self-acclaimed sister, deceased)<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Citizenshp:<\/b> American (presumed)<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Place of Birth:<\/b> Unrevealed<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Marital Status:<\/b> Single<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Occupation:<\/b> Adventurer; formerly U.S. government operative, Terrorist, geophysics graduate student<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Education:<\/b> Masters degree in geophysics, some doctoral research completed<\/li><\/ul><h2>Other Versions<\/h2><h3>Earth-295: Age of Apocalypse<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/239323-180903-polaris.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-239323\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1616161616162\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/239323-180903-polaris.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-239323\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6754\/239323-180903-polaris.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6754\/239323-180903-polaris.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Earth-295 Age of Apocalypse<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In the Age of Apocalypse reality she was only a frightening adolescent without powers when Apocalypse attacked humanity the first time, in this genocide her parents died, this tragedy led her to lose some of her sanity believing her herself to be Magneto\u00b4s Daughter.

Polaris was among the students who had passed a field test, allowing her to assist local authorities from time to time. During such a mission, Lorna's powers seemingly spiral out of control, killing dozens of humans before Havok is forced to subdue her. After being placed in the same prison that held Magneto, it is revealed that he had her set up, when one of the Brotherhood members placed a magnetic device near her location. Magneto uses her imprisonment to his advantage, knowing that Havok and the other students will come to her aid. During the chaos that ensues, Magneto switches places with Mystique, and Lorna's name is cleared. During the Ultimatum story line, Magneto sends his brotherhood to destroy the Academy of Tomorrow and kill all of the students within, including Polaris.<\/p><h3>Earth-9997<\/h3><p style=\"\">In the Earth X reality Polaris and Havok were members of the Starjammers.<\/p><h3>Earth-58163<\/h3><p style=\"\">In the <a href=\"..\/..\/house-of-m\/39-40991\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">House of M<\/a> reality Lorna was a member of Magneto's royal family and had a close relationship with her father.<\/p><h3>Earth-3931<\/h3><p style=\"\">In this reality Polaris was a vampire, and a member of the Avengers who all were vampires.<\/p><h3>Earth-8149<\/h3><p style=\"\">This Polaris was plucked from her reality moments before being killed by Sentinels resistant to her powers. She is now a member of the latest team of Exiles. In her original reality, many other mutants were dead, and fighting regularly by herself against greater odds has made her more experienced with combat and skilled with her powers than many other versions of her. This is seen very early in her first mission as an Exile, where she easily handles her counterpart due to the latter being a pampered Genoshan princess.<\/p><p style=\"\">She demonstrates her skill and power in fighting sentinels on the Exiles' second mission, defeating 4 sentinels by herself with barely any effort. However, she is captured by Ultron, Machine Man, and Vision by drugging her with a sedative while she was asleep. At present, she is a captive of the machines of that reality, and was witnessed by Blink to be in a seemingly dismembered and dissected state.<\/p><p style=\"\">Blink retaliates against Ultron, Machine Man, and Vision for doing what she sees as the brutal death of her teammate. In the ensuing battle, she destroys Cerebro's remote unit in the lab. Lorna reveals that she is alive, and what Blink saw was only a Life Model Decoy made to look like her. The others are also shown to be alive and well. The three robots, particularly Ultron (who is shown to harbor the mind of Hank Pym), reveal that they have been spending time preserving the consciousness of humanity in Cerebro's robotic constructs while pretending to be on Cerebro's side.<\/p><p style=\"\">While Blink takes Forge and Beast to destroy Cerebro's primary memory core, Polaris, Panther, Witch, Ultron, Machine Man and Vision distract Cerebro's primary robot forces.

When Iceman decided to apologize, he found out that Polaris is not already in their house. He thought that she was abducted by the X-Factor. As Iceman asks assistance from Jubilee, the X-men followed and fought the X-Factor. However, as the tension calms down as both parties confront each other, Polaris stated that she was not kidnapped. She became a member of the X-Factor and apologizes to Iceman because she fell in love with Havok who happened to be her team mate.

In the present, she is a lonely girl of about seventeen, isolated from most people. She wishes to see the world and live her life, but fears her father will do something rash if she chooses otherwise. She's daddy's little girl in this one, and worked at his every whim. However, Gambit later arrives and woos her into believing many things, one which included her being trapped in Genosha forever, for it was her cage, and a cage is still a cage, even if it do look like a palace. Polaris harbored some feelings for Gambit, and even attempted to run away with him. However, Gambit in the end betrayed her, and taught her the lesson which would eventually play a part in the coming episodes; the world was exactly like Gambit, distrustful, horrid, yet beautiful. After Gambit's failure in stealing Magneto's helmet, and departure, Lorna still harbors some lingering feelings for him. At the end of the season, Lorna leaves her father's side, and joins her sister, Wanda. Together, they banish their father and their brother off the island of Genosha, and clearly state that the old and dutiful Lorna was gone, and the new one would rise.<\/p><p style=\"\">Meanwhile, her version from the future is also a member of The House of Magnus, but she is the last member standing. When Genosha was destroyed by the Phoenix, Magneto arrived at a tough decision, and sacrifice his life for his daughter. Before he perished, he gave her his helmet and cape to Lorna as a symbol of a legacy passed on. Genosha was eventually destroyed, but Polaris became mentally unstable. When Professor X's future X-Men showed up, she fought them using her powers, which were as powerful as her father's by now, enough to scare Sentinels away, and be named badlands for the sake of it. She treated Professor X as his father's enemy, and blamed them all for his death. Though Professor X repeatedly stated that he is Magneto's friend and was not his enemy, Polaris still attacks, but then gives up when the Proff. calms her mind down, and gives her back her helmet and cape. He states clearly that Lorna was never the soldier, Magneto knew that, even Prof. knew that, so the poor girl was left to be in her ruined home while they left. However, in the season finale, Polaris returns with Marrow as what she'd finally trained herself to be what her father thought she'd never become, a soldier. She helped Prof. X and the others help destroy Master Mold.<\/p><h3>Video Games<\/h3><h4>Marvel: War of Heroes<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4953740-pacifistpolaris7+%281%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4953740\" data-ratio=\"1.252380952381\" data-width=\"210\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 210px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4953740-pacifistpolaris7+%281%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4953740\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4953740-pacifistpolaris7+%281%29.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4953740-pacifistpolaris7+%281%29.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Marvel: War of Heroes<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Polaris is featured in the mobile card game Marvel: War of Heroes.

Felicia then decided to don the \u201cBlack Cat\u201d identity because of a few reasons, cats have nine lives and land on their feet, crossing a black cat is bad luck, she is a cat burglar, she has a pet black cat named Onyx, and her father was the Black Cat.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4605480-amazing_spider-man_vol_1_194.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4605480\" data-ratio=\"1.5185185185185\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4605480-amazing_spider-man_vol_1_194.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4605480\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4605480-amazing_spider-man_vol_1_194.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4605480-amazing_spider-man_vol_1_194.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Black Cat first appearence<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Originally, the Black Cat was never intended to be a character in Spider-Man, nor a cat burglar. Marv Wolfman was writing Spider-Woman and was planning to create a female villain for Spider-Woman. That character would turn out to be the Black Cat. Carmine Infantino drew the cover for Spider-Woman #9, which was suppose to be the Black Cat's first appearance. However, the cover was rejected, and before Wolfman was about to have Infantino redesign the cover, he was switched to writing Amazing Spider-Man and took Black Cat with him. Now working on on Spider-Man and after a cover rejection for Amazing Spider-Man #194, he would finally introduce Black Cat on July 1979. She was illustrated by Keith Pollard, giving him co-creation rights to Black Cat.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4605482-1903513-walter_hardy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4605482\" data-ratio=\"1.479674796748\" data-width=\"246\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 246px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4605482-1903513-walter_hardy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4605482\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4605482-1903513-walter_hardy.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4605482-1903513-walter_hardy.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Felicia and Walter Hardy<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Felicia learned that her father was dying and was determined to not let his lasting moments be in a jail cell. She decided to break her father out of prison, but with careful planning at first. She breaks into the police station in order to gain information on criminals that will work for hire. Felicia would quickly cross paths with Spider-Man and she is forced to fend him off, succeeding and escaped from Spider-Man. As she was breaking her father out of prison she crosses paths with Spider-Man again, however Felicia was prepared this time. Even though Felicia had a hatred towards men since her date rape incident, she felt she had a special bond with Spider-Man. She had set up a trap near Spider-Man, which caused an explosion allowing Felicia and her father to escape. This was one of many tricks Felicia would use to force opponents to believe that she emits bad luck. She takes her father home to her mother and revealed that the Black Cat was his own daughter. Her father attempts to persuade her not to make the same mistake as he did and follow him down a dark path. Felicia ignores it and leaves him and her mother alone. Meanwhile, Spider-Man discovers that Felicia Hardy is the Black Cat when he goes through Walter Hardy\u2019s profile. Spider-Man would meet up with the Black Cat outside her home. The two begin fighting as Felicia does not want to end up in jail. Their battle ensues across the rooftops until they both slip off. However, Spider-Man was able to grab on to the ledge and hold on to Felicia. However, she slips and falls to what appeared to Spider-Man, to be her death. Felicia had become depressed after nearly dying, her father\u2019s death, and that she believed no one would recognize her skills except Spider-Man. Felicia continued her criminal career and became one of the most notorious Cat Burglars in the city. However, her real plan was to force Spider-Man to come after her. Spider-Man had placed a <a href=\"..\/..\/spider-tracer\/18-55656\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Tracer<\/a> on her that she could not remove.<\/p><p style=\"\">Knowing that she could never lose him with the tracer on her, she decided to lure him to a room that showed her obsession of Spider-Man with clippings of newspaper pictures of him covering the entire wall. Spider-Man decided to take Felicia to the Mitchell State Hospital and checked her in for a six month stay. Since Felicia was not really insane and was only pretending in order to avoid jail time for her crimes, she easily breaks out of the institution and continues her career as a cat burglar. Felicia moves into an apartment of her own and hides under a new alias, Felicia Harmon. She would also disguise herself with a curly black wig. Felicia went straight to work and stole an original Ehrenreich painting easily. However, she would quickly discover that she was beginning to become bored with her current lifestyle as she gained no fame and always hid in the shadows. She begins thinking about Spider-Man again and realizes how much she misses the excitement of being around him. Felicia decides to hire a sky writer and had him write a message in the sky to gain Spider-Man\u2019s attention. The message told Spider-Man to meet her at their \u201cfirst date,\u201d to which he receives and heads straight for the place. The Black Cat begins to flirt with Spider-Man and explains to him that she wants to quit her criminal career and help him fight crime. She continues to explain the reason for breaking her father out of jail and tries to rationalize that the people she stole from were the ones who stole the item first, or that they have enough money to buy a new one.<\/p><p style=\"\">She then confesses that she would do anything just so the two of them could have a relationship together. Afterwards, she leaves him along with the painting that she stole with a note, saying that if he accepts her offer to meet her at the costume party the next night. When Spider-Man arrives to meet up with Black Cat, she reveals to him that meeting her there was so she could prove that she could aid him in fighting crime. Spider-Man and the Black Cat was forced to fight a massive amount of the criminal underworld. However, Spider-Man and Black Cat would come out on top, and Spider-Man began to believe that she was serious in becoming good. Later, Felicia decides to steal a statue from a show room despite Spider-Man\u2019s disapproval.<\/p><p style=\"\">The owner discovers who the two really are and forced Spider-Man and Black Cat to fight. Spider-Man was shot in the leg, but he was able to beat the enemies up. Felicia had made her getaway during the crossfire, but <a href=\"..\/..\/spider-man\/29-1443\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man<\/a> chased her down to the docks, where he webs her entire body. She tells Spider-Man that she\u2019d rather die then go to jail and forces herself into the water. Spider-Man was still wounded and was unable to locate her whereabouts. Just afterwards, <a href=\"..\/..\/jean-dewolff\/29-2471\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain DeWolff<\/a> came to give her amnesty for her past crimes, but was too late.<\/p><h3>Black Cat's Relationship With Spider-Man<\/h3><p style=\"\">After an extended disappearance, Felicia had learned that <a href=\"..\/..\/kingpin\/29-1483\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingpin<\/a> had a nuclear detonator that he was going to auction off. The <a href=\"..\/..\/owl\/29-13908\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Owl<\/a> planned to use it against <a href=\"..\/..\/new-york-city\/34-41183\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York<\/a> to hold the city hostage while <a href=\"..\/..\/doctor-octopus\/29-1485\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Octopus<\/a> had planned to detonate the whole city with it. Felicia decided to steal the detonator and she gave the detonator to Spider-Man, and instantly became one of Octopus' enemies. Spider-Man tore off his mechanical arms though was still able to control them mentally and had held Hardy down while his men opened fire on her. Spider-Man had gotten Felicia to the hospital in time when they started operating on her multiple bullet and knife wounds. He quickly realized just how much he really cared for her. After Felicia recovered from her injuries, they soon began a relationship. Spider-Man decides to reveal his true identity to Felicia and brought her to his apartment. However, Felicia had a hard time accepting, as she could not understand why he wanted to live life as a civilian when he could use his Spider-Man alter-ego to become rich and famous. Spider-Man became hurt that she only loved Spider-Man and not <a href=\"..\/..\/spider-man\/29-1443\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter Parker<\/a>. However, Spider-Man rationalizes it that since his previous relationships ended because he had to keep his identity from them, but with Felicia, she loved his alter-ego.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1926412\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/95970\/1926412-1788539_13032481513.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.421926910299\" data-width=\"301\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 301px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/95970\/1926412-1788539_13032481513.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1926412\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/95970\/1926412-1788539_13032481513.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/95970\/1926412-1788539_13032481513.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Black Cat and Spider-Man<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Their attentions were quickly drawn to muggers harassing an innocent person. Spider-Man tells her to wait there, but she decides to tag along anyways. The two of them easily defeat the muggers, however Felicia shows signs of fatigue due to just recently being released from the hospital. While Spider-Man was battling against <a href=\"..\/..\/mr-hyde\/29-3233\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mr. Hyde<\/a>, she decided to join the battle in hopes of proving to Spider-Man that she could take care of herself in battle. However, Spider-Man continued to shout orders at her, and despite her knowing his good intentions, became angered that he was giving her orders and continued to try and protect her. Black Cat decides to try and engage against Mr. Hyde herself, to which she realizes that she was overwhelmed by his strength. Spider-Man intertwined to try and help, but was punched through the roof. Felicia had believed that Spider-Man was killed on that punch. <a href=\"..\/..\/cobra\/29-11895\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cobra<\/a> arrives and battles Mr. Hyde, where Black Cat sees an opening and trips him off his feet. After a near death experience, Felicia feared that the lack of powers (her \u201cbad luck\u201d was due to carefully planned traps set by Felicia herself to make her opponents believe she emits \u201cbad luck\u201d) would make her a liability for Spider-Man and was terrified that Spider-Man would be devastated if she were to die. During the <a href=\"..\/..\/secret-wars\/39-40978\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secret Wars<\/a>, when Spider-Man had left, Felicia seeks a way to gain superpowers to aid Spider-Man in battle. She first tried <a href=\"..\/..\/iron-man\/29-1455\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tony Stark<\/a>, only to discover he was missing. She then tried <a href=\"..\/..\/hank-pym\/29-2247\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hank Pym<\/a>, who did not return any of her calls. She then went to the <a href=\"..\/..\/avengers\/65-3806\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers<\/a> and the <a href=\"..\/..\/fantastic-four\/65-3804\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantastic Four<\/a> for help and was rejected.<\/p><p style=\"\">Felicia would seek out a mysterious person who agreed to help her gain superpowers by using Dr. Farley Stillwell\u2019s latent gene technique, similar to the <a href=\"\">Scorpion<\/a> and the <a href=\"\">Fly<\/a>. Felicia gained a latent mutant ability that allows her to emit bad luck to those around her. Felicia would soon learn that the mystery person was really the Kingpin, and Felicia was not pleased to hear the news. She had new powers, but was ashamed to tell Spider-Man. Angered that she had fallen into a trap by the Kingpin, and feared that he may call upon her for errands, and also fearing how Spider-Man would react if she told him. Felicia decides that it was best of she did not tell Spider-Man at all. She also thought up of an excuse if he asked her how she gained her new powers, she would just tell him that they were latent and she had them for a long time. She also decides that if the Kingpin orders her to do something, she just would not do it. She continued to search for Spider-Man, and while searching for Spider-Man in the <a href=\"..\/..\/avengers-mansion\/34-41036\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers Mansion<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/vision\/29-1504\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vision<\/a> offered her a membership to join the Avengers, but she turned it down. When Spider-Man finally returned from the Secret Wars with his new <a href=\"..\/..\/symbiotes\/65-56880\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">symbiote<\/a> costume, her new probability manipulation power were starting to affect Spider-Man already, which is exactly what the Kingpin wanted.<\/p><h3>The Break Up<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4608373-the-spectacular-spider-man_098_vol1976_marvel__comiclash.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4608373\" data-ratio=\"1.4988888888889\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4608373-the-spectacular-spider-man_098_vol1976_marvel__comiclash.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4608373\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4608373-the-spectacular-spider-man_098_vol1976_marvel__comiclash.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4608373-the-spectacular-spider-man_098_vol1976_marvel__comiclash.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Felicia and Spider-man part ways<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Eventually Spider-Man would discover her powers and confronts her about them. Felicia decides to just tell Spider-Man exactly how, why, and who she gained the powers from. She then reveals that she gained the powers from the Kingpin which stunned Spider-Man. She tries to rationalize with him that the reason she did it was so she could continue sharing their adventures together. Spider-Man then begins to lecture her about going to the Kingpin for power, then all of a sudden the roof that they were standing on collapsed. Spider-Man realizes that the accidents he had been having were caused by Felicia\u2019s latent ability. The two agreed to meet up with the Kingpin on the next night. The next night, Spider-Man arrives at Felicia\u2019s apartment, where she gives him a cloth version of the black costume ( Spider-Man had just gotten rid of the black suit because he discovered it was a symbiote).<\/p><p style=\"\">Spider-Man turned down her gift, and the two headed for the Kingpin's building. However, the two were encountered by the <a href=\"..\/..\/spot\/29-18270\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spot<\/a> atop of Kingpin's building. The Spot was successful in fending off Spider-Man and the Black Cat, so the two of them decided to regroup and try again later. However, Black Cat decides to go to Kingpin\u2019s place by herself. Once she arrived, she discovered that Spider-Man had thought of the same idea. However, she decided to let him deal with the Spot alone while she headed straight for the Kingpin. Felicia finally confronted the Kingpin who revealed his plans to her. He tells her that he had wanted to get revenge on her and Spider-Man for stealing the detonator and letting it fall into <a href=\"..\/..\/doctor-octopus\/29-1485\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Octopus<\/a>\u2019 hands, which forced the Kingpin to leave \u201chis\u201d city. Felicia then asks how giving her powers would help him gain his revenge, to which he explains that her powers cause bad luck to anyone around her. And the longer a person like Spider-Man stays around her, they would eventually die. Horrified at the news, she runs out of the building as Spider-Man enters to fight the Kingpin. Felicia decided to think by herself, and eventually concluded that she had to break up with Spider-Man in order to keep him out of harms way. Just as she was about to break up with Spider-Man, he tells her that they are too different for each other, and that he could not handle the fact that she loved Spider-Man more then Peter Parker. Spider-Man then breaks up with Felicia. She was in shock and was angered that he was the one who broke up with her. Spider-Man realized something was wrong, and with the help of <a href=\"..\/..\/doctor-strange\/29-1456\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Strange<\/a> he was able to take the hex off Spider-Man.<\/p><p style=\"\">However, this also altered the hex's source and altered Felicia\u2019s powers, making her new addition of powers super strength, agility, balance, super vision, and claws, all much like a cat. Felicia thought this was a reinvention of her, so she rekindled her relationship with Parker and stood by Spider-Man as he was accused of murder. They tracked down this elaborate scheme and fought a mercenary called <a href=\"..\/..\/foreigner\/29-13381\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foreigner<\/a>. Parker thought his life was falling apart when he came to discover that Felicia was in fact causing this. He also discovered that Felicia had never forgiven him for their break up and had started a relationship with Foreigner to gain revenge against Spider-Man. However, Felicia would eventually realize her true feelings for Peter and double crossed the Foreigner. Felicia decides to leave the country and went to <a href=\"..\/..\/europe\/34-56099\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Europe<\/a> to start a new life. This forced Peter to find a new relationship with <a href=\"..\/..\/mary-jane\/29-13380\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mary Jane<\/a> Watson. Years later, Hardy returned to America and learned from <a href=\"..\/..\/venom\/29-1486\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Venom<\/a> that Peter had gone on to marry Mary Jane, and started physically threatening her. She also started going out with <a href=\"..\/..\/flash-thompson\/29-1489\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flash Thompson<\/a> to spite Peter.<\/p><p style=\"\">They had cared for each other, but he broke up with Felicia as soon as he discovered her secret and Felicia became a better person by making amends with Peter and becoming friends with Mary Jane. Spider-Man was later exposed to a device which removed all his powers by the <a href=\"..\/..\/chameleon\/29-4458\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chameleon<\/a>, Felicia had helped in finding the device and after battling the Scorpion and the <a href=\"..\/..\/tarantula\/29-1528\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tarantula<\/a> (Luis Alvarez), was successful in restoring his powers, however she had lost her own powers in the process. In order to regain her abilities, Felicia purchased equipment from the <a href=\"..\/..\/tinkerer\/29-3144\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tinkerer<\/a> to help incorporate her abilities into her costume and occasionally teams up with Spider-Man. During <a href=\"..\/..\/maximum-carnage\/39-41409\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maximum Carnage<\/a>, Felicia aided Spider-Man and Venom in their battle against <a href=\"..\/..\/carnage\/29-1490\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carnage<\/a>. Felicia briefly accepted Venom\u2019s beliefs that they had to kill Carnage to stop him. However, she decides to go down the same road as Spider-Man and helped him stop Carnage without murdering him.<\/p><h3>New Life<\/h3><p style=\"\">Felicia later creates her own private investigations business called Cat\u2019s Eye Private Investigations. The P.I. office specializes in body guarding, background checks, bounty hunting, and installing burglarproof security systems. She is also residing in <a href=\"..\/..\/los-angeles\/34-56019\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Los Angeles<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/california\/34-55716\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">California<\/a>. Felicia gets a call from her friend Meg who was panicking that her friend Tracia had not checked in for a while. Felicia agrees to return to <a href=\"..\/..\/new-york-city\/34-41183\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York<\/a> to investigate her disappearance and was also hoping to see Spider-Man again. It has been five years since the two of them were in a romantic relationship, and Felicia was torturing herself over the fact that she was too spoiled back then, and it cost her a relationship with Spider-Man. She found a link between Tracia and a movie star named Hunter Todd, so she decided to head over to the Soho Grand Hotel where he was staying at. While there, Felicia sees a person creeping around the window and she decides to attack it. It turns out to be Spider-Man.<\/p><p style=\"\">After the two recover, Felicia asks for Tracia Lane while Spider-Man asks for a teenage boy who died named Donald Phillips. Todd\u2019s reaction assured the two that he knew the answers. Suddenly, Todd begins to overdose on Heroine, and the same happens to the woman he was with. Someone begins talking through the phone, to which Spider-Man answers. It was <a href=\"..\/..\/garrison-klum\/29-11542\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mr. Brownstone<\/a>, and he tells him that he is giving them an overdose and hangs up. The two of them argue for a bit on the rooftop, then they decide to go patrol the city until they see smoke from a building. They engage against the villain and defeats her easily. Afterwards they were thanked by <a href=\"..\/..\/garrison-klum\/29-11542\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Garrison Klum<\/a>, and Spider-Man believes that man is Mr. Brownstone. Felicia and Spider-Man decides to ask the girl they just arrested who hired her to kill the guy, she eventually gives in when Spider-Man annoyed her too much. When they arrived to the house of the person who hired the hit, they discovered him and his wife chopped to bits, but the baby was allowed to live. Both of them decided to scare Mr. Brownstone, but that was all Spider-Man had planned. He said there was not enough evidence to catch him, and it angered Felicia. They get into a heated argument and then a fight. Felicia was able to web Spider-Man to the floor and she went after Brownstone herself.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4608386-amazing-spider-man-677_cover-art.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4608386\" data-ratio=\"1.5175\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4608386-amazing-spider-man-677_cover-art.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4608386\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4608386-amazing-spider-man-677_cover-art.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4608386-amazing-spider-man-677_cover-art.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Black Cat, Spider-Man &amp; Daredevil<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Felicia sneaks into Brownstone\u2019s place and tries to kill him, but he was not in his bed.

After he was done, he teleported the Heroine into Felicia causing her to overdose on Heroine. Felicia was now helpless and in Brownstone\u2019s hands. Brownstone was attempting to rape her. However, Brownstone was killed before he could rape her and Felicia is charged with murdering Brownstone. Meanwhile, Spider-Man teams up with <a href=\"..\/..\/daredevil\/29-24694\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daredevil<\/a> to break Felicia out of jail. When they arrive, they discovered <a href=\"..\/..\/mysterio\/29-4333\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Francis Klum<\/a> ( Garrison\u2019s brother) holding Felicia, he makes Daredevil and Spider-Man fight each other and teleports out of <a href=\"..\/..\/rykers-island\/34-55830\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ryker<\/a>\u2019s. It is revealed that Francis was the one who killed Garrison, and while he was teleporting Felicia, he told her about the times his brother sexually harassed him. He tells her that he saved her because he was sick of what Garrison was doing. Felicia wanted to get help for Francis, but he is scared that he will get the death penalty. However, she assures him that he is not to worry because he is sick.

Spider-Man was hurt when Francis teleported Felicia\u2019s mask into his neck, then picks up a gun and points it at Felicia for betraying him. Spider-Man webs the gun, but he falls off the bridge and Spider-Man could not catch him, but Francis teleports mid-air and disappears. The next day, Peter and Felicia takes a walk in the park and she was ready to tell him what had happened to her during college. Felicia would later team up with Spider-Man and <a href=\"..\/..\/puma\/29-15238\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Puma<\/a> to battle against <a href=\"..\/..\/stegron\/29-7776\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stegron<\/a>.

Her natural hair color is black and wears a white wig as part of her costume. When Felicia was a young girl, she saw her father sent to prison for being a cat burglar. Her father eventually died in prison and Felicia blamed the Kingpin for the death of her father and vowed to take revenge. Fifteen years after her father died, Felicia became an accountant for the company Fisk Enterprise and spent her nights stealing from Manhattan's more prominent office buildings, under the disguise of the Black Cat. When a man named Mr. Moore offered to buy his way into the Kingpin's organization with an inscribed stone tablet that the Kingpin desired, Felicia broke into his apartment and stole the tablet from his office safe. While escaping with the tablet, she encountered Spider-Man but used her bad luck powers to evade him. Video footage was captured of the two of them together and the police suspected that they were partners in crime. Intrigued by this accusation, Felicia decided to place an advertisement in the Daily Bugle newspaper, asking Spider-Man to meet her on the rooftop near the site of their confrontation. Spider-Man met her there and she flirted with in and brought him cheese and wine. However, their reunion was interrupted by Elektra, who was hired to retrieve to tablet. Felicia and Elektra battled, until Spider-Man intervened and both Felicia and Electra escaped. Spider-Man remembered the comments that Felicia said to Elektra about telling the Kingpin she was not her father, so decided to search the Daily Bugle records to find out her identity. He realized that if he could find these documents, so could the Kingpin so he raced to Felicia's apartment to find her already in the hands of Kingpin. Spider-Man's arrival gave Felicia a opening to break free and she fled to the roof of her apartment. The Kingpin and the assassin Elektra pursued her but just as they were about to reach Felicia, she threw the tablet in the harbor. Angry, Elektra threw her sai into Felicia's chest and she fell from the roof into the sea, apparently dead.<\/p><p style=\"\">Felicia returned several months later to help aid Spider-Man during the war between Kingpin's forces and the Hammerhead. Felicia showed interest in joining Hammerhead's forces if it meant she could get a chance to kill Kingpin. After the crisis was resolved, she kissed Spider-Man through his mask and showed that her previous interest in him had developed. However, Felicia had no idea about the age difference between her and Spider-Man and assumed that he left in a rush because he was a married man. When she unmasked him and realized how young he was, she was disgusted and due to the shock and embarrassment, she puked on his uniform and left.<\/p><p style=\"\">After Ultimatum, she returned to New York City with a new Black Cat costume. She witnessed Kingpin being blasted out of his building and killed by Mysterio while she ready to snipe him across from his building. Disappointed that she was unable to kill Kingpin, Felicia focused on her second objective- getting the Zodiac Key from Kingpin's safe. After the police search Kingpin's office, Felicia returns and finds the safe, however, just as she opened it, Mysterio arrived. Felicia tried to make a deal with Mysterio that she would stay out of his way if he gave her the contents inside the safe. Mysterio refuses her offer and asks her to join him in a partnership, of which she suggests he gives her the safe as a goodwill gesture. Mysterio refuses to give up the safe and attacks Felicia and they battle for a short time before Felicia escapes through a window. Felicia tracks down Mysterio, who now has the key and just as she is about make her move, Spider-Man appears and attacks Mysterio. Their fight causes the destruction of Mysterio's hideout. A week later, Felicia finds the key, but Mysterio confronts her again. He explains that the key is a relic that the Kingpin used during his reign in power and that she doesn't know it's true powers. However, Felicia uses it's powers to escape. Later, Mysterio tracks her down at her apartment, offering a deal. Felicia explains that she doesn't know how to activate it, but accidentally activates it and destroys a few blocks of the city. Guilty, she gives the key back to Mysterio. Iron Man and Spider-Man later appears, and with Felicia's help, they defeat him. She later assist Spider-man helping the people affected by the blast.<\/p><h3>Zombieverse<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1936098\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/95970\/1936098-zombies.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.86261261261261\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/95970\/1936098-zombies.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1936098\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/95970\/1936098-zombies.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/95970\/1936098-zombies.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Zombieverse<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Black Cat's history before the zombie plague struck is very similar to her 616 counterpart.

She is also superficial, asking Parker to put his mask back on as she couldn't live with the thought of Spider-Man being an average guy. This is due to her greedy personality, from stealing many precious items as they get the better of her and she becomes reckless in her relationships. Even so, her obsession with Spider-Man shows that she is determined and has a strong will, and shows that nothing will get in her way.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p style=\"\">When the Black Cat was first introduced into comics, she was just an average human being that possessed no super-human abilities. However, she was an highly skilled martial artist and a top athlete and gymnast. After she decided to become a crime fighter and began her relationship with Spider-Man, she realized that her lack of super-human power may cause Spider- Man to be killed should he become over run by an enemy.<\/p><h3>Former Powers<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1926398\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/95970\/1926398-1788539_13032481513.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.1710526315789\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:117.1%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/95970\/1926398-1788539_13032481513.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1926398\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/95970\/1926398-1788539_13032481513.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/95970\/1926398-1788539_13032481513.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Black Cat's bad luck power in action<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\"><b>Feline Abilities-<\/b> After Black Cat's powers were removed by Doctor Strange, the process caused her body to be mutated which granted her with special abilities.

Peter would try multiple times, to go on a date with Felicia, but she would constantly turn him down. Felicia had been saved by Spider-Man a few times before. Her mother, Anastasia Hardy, was a normal business woman and mother. Her father on the other hand, John Hardesky, was a well known jewel thief called \"The Cat.\" When her father was a young boy, he memorized the Super Soldier Serum during World War II.

This was because he had memorized the Super Soldier Formula, and that knowledge makes it too dangerous for him to be out in the public. Eventually the Kingpin would get his hands on Hardesky and force him to give up the Super Soldier Formula. To make sure Hardesky gave him the proper formula, they tested it on Felicia. She gained enhanced strength, speed, and stamina. Felicia was also able to alter her appearance, giving her white hair instead of her natural blond in the series. Eventually Spider-Man would arrive and they defeat the Kingpin.

Spider-Man knows that she doesn't have the Symbiote, but is unaware that it has began bonding to his own suit. Later, Chameleon, with the help of Mysterio and Phineas Mason, begins framing Spider-Man for crimes he did not commit. Eventually, Spider-Man seeks the aid of Black Cat. She helps him to infiltrate a boat-side robbery and stop Chameleon. At the end of the episode, Felicia kisses Spider-Man, hiding a necklace that she stole, behind his back. In season two, Black Cat returns for two episodes. In the episode \"Accomplices\", she tries to steal the formula for the Rhino, but before she could, Hammerhead, Silver Sable, and other gang mobs appeared, as they were auctioning the formula off. Knowing the situation, she quietly walked away. In the episode \"Opening Night\", She tries to break out her Father, Walter Harvey, in prison. Little did she know, Spider-man was also there due to testing out the new prison security. It is later revealed that Walter was the burglar who shot Uncle Ben.

She goes by the name Spider-Woman and much like Spider-Man of Earth 616 used her newly found powers to for more personal gain rather than helping people by becoming a professional drummer. Peter Parker remained a weak individual that Gwen needed to save from bullying. This made him develop an inferiority complex causing him to create a serum to make himself more like Gwen after she has revealed to him her powers. This causes him to become Earth 65's version of the Lizard and Gwen is forced to fight him. Unfortunately due to the serum during the battle Peter dies and she vows to use her powers for good. Unfortunately Gwen is blamed for Peter's death and a campaign against her (spearheaded by J.

Aleksei tracks Captain Stacy down at a Mary Janes concert and attacks him there, Gwen steps in and is able to defeat him but is cornered by her own father. There she reveals to him that she is Spider-Woman and he allows her to escape.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gwen is recruited to take part in the Spider-Verse event where Spider-Men from every reality are being hunted down by Morlun and his family. She is one of Spider-Man's (616) right hand members but he is unwilling to risk her in dangerous situations since he couldn't save his own Gwen Stacy. They promise to look after each others backs.<\/p><p style=\"\">On one mission Gwen travels to a reality that after this reality's Gwen Stacy died Spider-Man became bitter and more ruthless, eventually turning into the Hobgoblin.

However, she understands eventually in the film that Peter was never out for the way she would've wanted him to be, and instead apologizes to Mary Jane for her actions. However, Gwen Stacy is saved by Spiderman in a crane accident, whom she portrays to have some vague feelings for, and even kisses him in front of an audience.

Gwen is not the comic-canon buxom blond of the series as she is quite frequently portrayed as, but instead, she is a more strong willed, and kind person, harboring deep feelings for her best friend Peter. She also wears glasses, something very different from other incarnations. The show starts with the beginning of Junior Year in high school for Gwen, Stacy, and Harry. There they meet the harsh jocks, including Flash Thompson, annoying cheerleaders, and more so, opportunities all three know are out to get them. Early on, Peter and Gwen both are recommended by their science teachers to go and attend an internship at famous scientist Curt Connors office, ironically the exact place where Peter's good friend and mentor Eddie Brock also holds an internish at. Gwen, Edie, and peter spend many nights working alongside the doctor, but Peter is eventually kicked off the team due to his frequent disappearances and somewhat carelessness towards his Peter Parker duties whilst being Spiderman. Throughout the whole first season, Gwen is shwn to be very fond of Peter, however, often criticizes him about his duties, responsibilites, and frequent 'no-tells.' The first season ends with Gwen kissing Peter on the lips on Thanksgiving night, leaving him surprised.<\/p><p style=\"\">The second season starts off with Peter ignoring Gwen about their first kiss. The season continues with Peter attempting to choose between cheerleader Liz Allan and his best friend Gwen. Eventually, Peter picks Liz over Gwen, and gwen goes out with harry. Canon slightly makes it's way into the show when Gwen is kidnapped by Venom, and held up high over fifty feet high, paying homage to the Bridge scene from the comics. Spiderman goes after her, sucessfully saving her, and still being able to keep his secret safe. At the end of season two, Spiderman breaks up with Liz Allan, comes to his senses, and takes baby steps to pursue a relationship with Gwen. However, Gwen is still with Harry, and continues to stay with him out of guilt because of Norman Osbourne's so called death. Gwen is still harbouring feelings for Peter, but cannot be with him because of Harry's issues. Season 3 is rumored to be set in a love triangle between Peter, Gwen, and Harry, Harry's struggle with his father's death, Gwen's feelings for Peter getting more serious, Peter realizing his feelings for Gwen are getting more serious, and the introduction to the characters of Hobgoblin and Scorpion.<\/p><h4>Games<\/h4><h4>Marvel Heroes<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/5086767-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5086767\" data-ratio=\"2.6950354609929\" data-width=\"141\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 141px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:269.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/5086767-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5086767\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/5086767-1.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/5086767-1.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Marvlel Heroes<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Gwen is a team up character in her Spider-Gwen Persona.

Like Spider-Man, Gwen initially used her powers for financial gain by becoming a professional drummer while maintaining a secret identity as \u201cSpider-Woman\u201d and drumming off to the side in her friends\u2019 band, \u201cThe Mary Janes.\u201d The Peter Parker of this Earth was bullied quite often, and Gwen often came to his defense, causing Peter to develop an inferiority complex. After Gwen revealed to him that she was Spider-Woman, Peter desired to be special like Gwen and created a serum which turned him into that universe's version of the Lizard. The serum causes Peter to go mad, and Gwen is forced to fight her friend. Due to the serum, Peter dies in the middle of the battle, and Spider-Woman is falsely accused of his murder and is on the run from the authorities. Soon after, Gwen is pulled into the fight against the Inheritors, which spans across the entire Spider-Verse.<\/p><h4>Contest of Champions<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/14\/148344\/5086766-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5086766\" data-ratio=\"1.0504201680672\" data-width=\"238\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 238px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:105.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/14\/148344\/5086766-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5086766\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/5086766-1.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/5086766-1.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spider-Gwen in Contest of Champions<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Spider-Gwen is a playable fighter in Contest of Champions.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4>Marvel Future Fight<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4957051-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4957051\" data-ratio=\"2.3218390804598\" data-width=\"174\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 174px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:232.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4957051-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4957051\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4957051-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4957051-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Marvel Future Fight<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Spider-Gwen is a playable character in the game.<\/p><h4>Marvel: War of Heroes<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4981343-earth-65spider-gwen7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4981343\" data-ratio=\"1.252380952381\" data-width=\"210\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 210px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4981343-earth-65spider-gwen7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4981343\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4981343-earth-65spider-gwen7.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4981343-earth-65spider-gwen7.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Marvel: War of Heroes<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Spider-Gwen appears in several cards in the mobile card game Marvel: War of Heroes.

As a result of this the two leave in different apartments though their relationship is still intact.<\/p><h2><b>Powers and Abilities<\/b><\/h2><p style=\"\">Misty Knight is highly skilled in martial arts and is a proficient hand-to-hand combatant, with police combat training. She also has near-perfect aim with firearms, and possesses superb detective skills. Her bionic arm is 75 times superhumanly stronger than a normal arm, and she can punch a target with incredible force, or crush objects as tough as steel in her vise-like grip. However, since the rest of her body is not cybernetically enhanced, she cannot lift objects heavier than her back, shoulders, and legs can physically support. Her arm's advantages as a weapon are limited to kinetic crushing and impact forces.<\/p><p style=\"\">Her original bionic right arm is an alloy of Antarctic <a href=\"\/vibranium\/4055-40919\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40919\">vibranium<\/a> and diamond; at close range it can liquefy all known metals including adamantium. It is also now able to generate a wide anti-gravity repulsor field similar to Iron Man's armor. It can also apparently release a concentrated beam of cryogenic energy, which can cover a target in a blanket of ice from a distance. This cold also seems to make the target much more fragile, allowing otherwise durable materials to be broken or rended when frozen. Iron Man also revealed the arm also displays technopathic capabilities, teaching Misty how to control a horde of robots. Following her \"pregnancy\", Danny Rand spent money on additional features to the arm, including magnetism and a concussive blast.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Physical Attributes<\/b><\/p><ul><li>Height: 5'9''<\/li><li>Weight: 136 lbs<\/li><li>Eyes: Brown<\/li><li>Hair: Black<\/li><\/ul><h2><b>Alternate Realities<\/b><\/h2><h3><b>Earth-295 - Age of Apocalypse<\/b><\/h3><p style=\"\">In the <a href=\"\/age-of-apocalypse\/4045-40752\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40752\">Age of Apocalypse<\/a> she was an armless human living on the streets captured and chained by <a href=\"\/scavengers\/4005-51092\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51092\">Scavengers<\/a> so they could eat her later.

They fought against numerous threads. The team continued to operate after the chaos caused by Onslaught and the apparent deaths of many of the Marvel heroes.

It was however during this time that the Super Human Civil War started witch was a conflict over whether or not super-humans should be forced to register with the U.S. government. Colleen and Misty started and became part of a new <a href=\"\/heroes-for-hire\/4060-23588\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23588\">Heroes for Hire<\/a> team, authorized by Tony Stark after the Superhero Registration act was passed. Colleen was identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who registered as part of the Initiative. The team's main purpose started out to apprehend heroes that had not registered. This brought her into conflict with their former friends and partners Iron Fist and Luke Cage, whom where both on the opposite side of the law. Luckily, the team did not interact with them personally during this time. The team soon grew and had new team-members such as a new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/maria-vasquez\/4005-80465\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80465\">Tarantula<\/a>, <a href=\"\/humbug\/4005-30619\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30619\">Humbug<\/a>, <a href=\"\/paladin\/4005-10584\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10584\">Paladin<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/orka\/4005-13400\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13400\">Orka<\/a>. The Orka later had a huge crush on Misty Knight until he was killed. In her group's more recent mission, Colleen Wing and her team where send to the Savage Land to apprehend Moon-Boy and take him over to the authorities. While the team found Moon-Boy and managed to capture him, Colleen was very much doubting whether or not the should give the creature to the authorities. Moon-Boy started to like Colleen too and they bonded. Upon their return to New York, the city was besieged by Hulk during World War Hulk. Colleen and <a href=\"\/tarantula\/4005-1528\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1528\">Tarantula<\/a> were offered to the <a href=\"\/brood-queen\/4005-14746\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14746\">Brood Queen<\/a> by their possessed teammate <a href=\"\/humbug\/4005-30619\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30619\">Humbug<\/a>.

Her parents had a tight and tense relationship because her father was a strict law student, where as her mother was a free-spirited entertainer. Their relationship ultimately came to an end, when Katherine walked out on Carter while Alison was still a child, leaving Carter to raise her alone. Katherine's departure had a strong effect on Carter, who decided to keep her leaving a secret from Alison for the rest her life.<\/p><p style=\"\">As Alison entered adolescence, and developed an ambition of becoming a talented singer, her father became extremely intolerant of the idea. He forced her to choose a life similar to his own and follow an education in law. However, despite her father's actions, Alison became a singer as well as continuing her path to law school. Alison's grandmother, Bella Blaire, was more sympathetic toward Alison and encouraged her to explore her real talents.<\/p><p style=\"\">However, while Alison was performing at a high school dance show, her mutant powers manifested, and she was forced to blind all in attendance to save herself from persecution. After this event, Alison hid her mutation for years, afraid of what she was capable of. This only caused further alienation between she and her father. By the time she was ready for college, Alison began to explore her mutation and continued excelling in her musical career. She created her own unique performing suit, with mirrored clothes, make-up, and a pair of roller-skates. She also gave herself the nickname, 'Dazzler.' At her graduation ceremony, she informed her father that she was not going to be attending the law school he'd selected. Instead she opted to pursue her career as a singer, with or without Carter's blessing and financial support.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p style=\"\">The creation of Dazzler was the result of a cross-promotion between <a href=\"\/marvel\/4010-31\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel<\/a> and a musical record label called Casablanca Records. Sometime around 1980, Casablanca approached Marvel with the idea of creating a new comic hero, while at the same time in the real world a new artist (working for Casablanca) would take on the same persona as this character. <a href=\"\/john-romita-jr\/4040-13709\" data-ref-id=\"4040-13709\">John Romita Jr.<\/a> designed her first costume, but the remainder of Dazzler's character traits came together from the input of many people.

Dazzler made her first appearance in <a href=\"\/the-uncanny-x-men\/4050-3092\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3092\">Uncanny X-Men<\/a> #130 before the development had finished, and the cross promotion eventually collapsed, with Dazzler's solo series beginning in 1981.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Meeting other Mutants<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1898175\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/33710\/1898175-x_men131_09b.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.1829268292683\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:118.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/33710\/1898175-x_men131_09b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1898175\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/33710\/1898175-x_men131_09b.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Dazzler meets the X-Men<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In one of her first major appearances, she managed to beat out the <a href=\"\/enchantress\/4005-7225\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7225\">Enchantress<\/a> during an audition for a local talent agency, despite the fact that the goddess used her magicks to enhance her singing ability.

During her adventures with the team, Dazzler was \"killed,\" multiple times, only to recover soon after. The first incident occurred after a gig in an English night club where she was killed by an evil Jean Grey. She later miraculously woke up in the hospital, having been given a clean bill of health. Her second \"death,\" occurred during battle with <a href=\"\">Black Tom<\/a>. One of his henchmen shot her in the back, but after a few moments she got up, dusted herself off and was essential in his defeat. So far, there has been no explanation as to her bizarre reincarnations.

Eventually, he regained his feelings for and memories of, his lover.Together, they left their teams to re-establish their relationship, but what transpired between them remains unknown.

While on the plane, a man caused a bit of a ruckus, going so far as to take a flight attendant hostage. Dazzler tricked the man into singing a duet to distract him. As the song ended, Dazzler blinded him with a light show and blasted him into unconsciousness. Another passenger was so impressed with her performance that he approached her about singing (once a week for a month) at a nightclub he owned. Dazzler accepted and now resides on Utopia with the other powered mutants.<\/p><p style=\"\">As she adjusted to life in Cali, her career finally became somewhat steady.

Dazz made her entrance with little flickers of light dancing around her head. She stayed with Pixie to raise her morale. As she left, she invited Pixie to join her on stage in future shows, due to the winged girl's mutant abilities. Pixie politely declined the offer, explaining that she felt as though being an X-Man wasn't exactly for her.

Dazzler used her abilities to shed some light on the subject and the trio gets a good peep show, since Cyke is buck naked. He quickly covers up, and as he storms out of the room, he catches a whiff of alcohol on Pixie's breath. She realized what had happened and teleports away. As Cyke reprimanded the two adults, he was suddenly hit with a psychic message from Emma.<\/p><p style=\"\">She attempted to alert them to an attack from the <a href=\"..\/..\/sisterhood-of-mutants\/65-26989\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sisterhood of Mutants<\/a>, but was subdued by <a href=\"..\/..\/lady-mastermind\/29-12055\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lady Mastermind<\/a>.

Mortis' fragile mind was being manipulated by Selene who combined her talents with the deadly mutant's already existing inferiority complex. This resulted in her unbridled hatred toward Dazzler. She tried to convince her sister to stop fighting, but to no avail. When Selene was finally defeated, Lois teleported to an unknown destination with <a href=\"..\/..\/blink\/29-12548\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blink<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Shortly thereafter, Mortis contacted her sister and set up several meetings to discuss a variety of topics. Dazzler was hesitant, and rightly so, Lois missed all but one of them. The one meeting she did attend resulted in Dazzler being drugged and having quite the rude awakening in <a href=\"..\/..\/murderworld\/34-41963\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Murderworld<\/a>. Lois concocted a scheme with <a href=\"..\/..\/arcade\/29-8429\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arcade<\/a> to use his maniacal machinations to end Dazzler's life. While in Arcade's \"fun,\" house, Dazzler fought against artificially synthesized versions of some of her worst former nemeses. (including her one time boss, Galactus) Dazzler was able to defeat every single one, pushing her powers to extents she'd never reached before. Her victory, however complete, did not last long. Klaw appeared (despite being \"killed,\" by Dazzler years ago) and explained how he'd heard Lois' cries of hatred against Dazzler and opted to join forces with Lois in her attempt to destroy her half-sister. Dazzler learned that Klaw reconstituted himself independent of her power, and was now able to resist it. The ensuing battle (though quite exhaustive for Dazzler) resulted in Klaw fleeing for his life. Subsequently she defeats Lois and brings her to Utopia to be treated for the damage Selene had done. Cyclops initially denied Lois residence on the island, but with some harsh words from Dazzler concerning other reformed villains (particularly Emma), he decided to let Lois stay. He refused however, to allow Emma to help in her recovery, but Psylocke agrees to help mend Lois' broken mind.<\/p><h3>Second Coming<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1288654\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/1288654-1198970_40f6b23b7bacba61574722ebd6e11e48.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.71111111111111\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.1%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/1288654-1198970_40f6b23b7bacba61574722ebd6e11e48.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1288654\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6754\/1288654-1198970_40f6b23b7bacba61574722ebd6e11e48.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6754\/1288654-1198970_40f6b23b7bacba61574722ebd6e11e48.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Dazzler in Limbo<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Shortly thereafter Dazzler teamed up with Cyclops once again to enter <a href=\"..\/..\/limbo\/34-42990\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Limbo<\/a> and retrieve <a href=\"..\/..\/illyana-rasputin\/29-8303\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magik<\/a> from her imprisonment therein.

Realizing N'astirh was less of a threat than the twisted trio, Pixie join forces with him to defeat them. She and N'Astirh are soon at their wits end and loss seemed imminent. Just then, Cannonball arrived with Anole and they took out Northstar without breaking a sweat. Gambit then sent Dazzler after Pixie. As Dazzler approached her, Pixie tried to reach the true Dazzler, reminding her that they'd been friends. Dazzler ignored this and prepared to attack. Luckily, Anole took her out with a strong deck to the face. Pixie was then able to release Illyana and together they stab Gambit with their <a href=\"\/soulsword\/4055-42991\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42991\">Soulswords<\/a>. The interference this magic created allows Gambit's real personality to defeat the demons controlling him. As Gambit was released from Death's harsh persona, Dazzler and Northstar returned to normal. With Illyana saved and Limbo back under her control the team safely teleported (with Pixie's help) back to Utopia.<\/p><h3>Curse of the Mutants<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1373812\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/56742\/1373812-daz2.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.79620853080569\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/56742\/1373812-daz2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1373812\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/56742\/1373812-daz2.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/56742\/1373812-daz2.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Taking down the Vamps with ease<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Soon, Dazzler found herself part of an away team sent to a vampire populated island to retrieve <a href=\"..\/..\/dracula\/29-7206\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dracula<\/a>'s corpse in order to resurrect it. The mission was ultimately a failure, since her UV light producing powers prove ineffective against the vampires. Turns out they were equipped with special light bending medallions. She only makes it out alive with the help of her good friend, Northstar. Emma (who was also part of the team) scolded Dazzler saying she was completely useless in the fight, apart from giving her tan lines. They attacked a second time, again Northstar came to her aid removing the medallions so Dazzler was able to defeat a large group of vampires with relative ease.<\/p><p style=\"\">After this, Dazzler investigated a series of vampire murders near the nightclub scene. After visiting a certain club, Alison's search for vampires yielded no results. The only thing she did find was a man who hit on her. In order to avoid any further come-ons, Dazzler left, but the man wouldn't take a hint. Dazzler turned on him, screaming at him to leave her alone. All of a sudden, he was attacked by a vampire. Dazzler fried him, but the vampire escaped. She followed the vampire on her motorbike, to his hideout. She staked out the joint, learning he was part of a gang of vampires that didn't feed on human blood. The vampire was trying to get the guy who'd hit on her, to leave her alone. This saddened Dazzler and made her reconsider her attitude to vampires.<\/p><p style=\"\">Her career in Utopia went on. Fellow residents, <a href=\"..\/..\/frenzy\/29-2163\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frenzy<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/nekra\/29-13896\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nekra Sinclair<\/a>, decided to take a different tack and turn to villainy. They formed an alliance and committed all sorts of crimes unbeknownst to Cyke and Emma. They went to San Francisco to burn down a museum and endanger civilians. Dazzler and Northstar teamed up again to stop them. They told the two renegades that they can't just do whatever they want and that they knew the two women were better than this. These admonitions fell on deaf ears and a two-on-two fight broke out. At first, Frenzy had the upper hand on Dazzler, but she took Frenzy down using a powerful energy blast. The two defeat the would-be villainesses right in front of a crowd of cheering civilians. Which only further boosted the popularity of the two X-Men.<\/p><h3>Quarantine<\/h3><p style=\"\">Shortly after the event known as the <a href=\"\/second-coming\/4045-55971\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55971\">Second Coming<\/a>, the inhabitants on Utopia came down with a nasty disease. During this time the mutants that weren't on the island were charged with carrying out the duties of the X-Men, while all the mutants on Utopia battled the virus. The uninfected mutants were only Storm and Archangel , with Pixie, Dazzler, and Northstar having been at one of Dazz's concerts when the virus hit the island. The disease turned out to be a mutant-only flu that robbed them of their powers, in addition to making them extremely sick. The un-quarantined X-Men are left to defend San Francisco as well as finding whomever had created the virus. The team first encountered a biologically engineered version of the original 5 X-Men (Cyclops, Beast, <a href=\"\/iceman\/4005-1464\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman<\/a>, Archangel, and Jean Grey) that <a href=\"\/lobe\/4005-66244\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66244\">Lobe<\/a> had engineered from a serum of the mutant genome with the <a href=\"\/sublimecorp\/4060-57964\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57964\">Sublime Corporation<\/a>'s assistance. Lobe had also been outed as the creator of the mutant flu, and thus revealed plans to patent all known mutations and market them to the public.<\/p><p style=\"\">He had success with the more wealthy inhabitants of San Francisco during a party at the Triumph Hill Ballroom. The five untainted mutants battled his minions, including: <a href=\"\/bouncing-betty\/4005-66242\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66242\">Bouncing Betty<\/a>, <a href=\"\/verre\/4005-66246\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66246\">Verre<\/a>, <a href=\"\/burst\/4005-66243\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66243\">Burst<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/thug\/4005-66245\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66245\">Thug<\/a>. The battle ended well for the small team, until Lobe released the serum to the entire crowd of people, granting the guests the varied powers of all the mutants on Earth. Again the battle starts in their favor, until the sheer number of mutates created overwhelmed them. A deathly ill and depowered team of X-Men from Utopia alights on the mainland to assist Storm's team. As the battle raged on, most of the transformed humans believed themselves superior, seeing that the X-Men were powerless. However, Lobe and the other mutates from the party became infected. Cyclops then forced Lobe to release the antidote leaving the humans with the message that being a mutant means being persecuted, hunted, and manipulated.<\/p><h3>Fear Itself<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1992406\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101742\/1992406-dazzlerbanshee.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.45286059629331\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:45.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101742\/1992406-dazzlerbanshee.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1992406\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101742\/1992406-dazzlerbanshee.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101742\/1992406-dazzlerbanshee.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Siryn &amp; Dazzler Combine Powers<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In her latest adventure, she is thrown into a battle with the Unstoppable <a href=\"\/juggernaut\/4005-1445\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\">Juggernaut<\/a> who had been granted even more tremendous power by the <a href=\"\/midgard-serpent\/4005-14471\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14471\">Midgard Serpent<\/a>.

She needed a mutant. After going through lists of X-Men and mutants, she decided to call in Dazzler, who agreed to work as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. And so, Ali Blaire became Maria Hill's mutant liaison. In this capacity, Dazzler worked to stay informed of mutant affairs, and to bridge the gap between the X-Men and S.H.I.E.L.D. that had been created by years of distrust and deception as well as the more recent Avengers versus X-Men incident. Her major assignment was to locate the mutant revolutionary Scott Summers, and to either talk him into turning himself in, or to shut him down. Neither of these ended up happening, but Ali gave it her best effort anyway. She tracked down Fabio Medina, aka Goldballs, a new mutant that had been recruited by Cyclops and his revolution. Goldballs wasn't sue he wanted to be a part of Cyclops's team, and so he was let go. When he returned to his home, Dazzler found him, and talked to Fabio and his family, trying to get a location for Cyclops's base out of him. Goldballs, who truly did not know, didn't cooperate. Therefore, he was taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, and locked away in a helicarrier. When Scott Summers found out, he had Magik teleport his team to the helicarrier's prison cell to free Fabio. When they arrived, Dazzler had been questioning Fabio. There was a brief, non-violent confrontation between the two parties, and then Scott's team, along with Fabio disappeared, leaving Ali locked in the cell. Later on, when she was let out, she returned to her living quarters on board the helicarrier, feeling defeated. She was visited by who appeared to be Phil Coulson. He consoled her, offered her a warm beverage, and said he was a huge fan of her music. Dazzler thanked him, and drank from the cup he offered her. She began to choke and sputter, and passed out. This \"Phil Coulson\" revealed himself to be Mystique in disguise. She then assumed the appearance of Dazzler, saying that she meant what she'd said: she was a huge Dazzler fan. For the next couple of months, Dazzler was kept imprisoned in a facility on Madripoor. Mystique, all the while posing as Agent Dazzler, used her DNA to manufacture Mutant Growth Hormone (MGH), a drug that granted the user temporary powers. As Dazzler, Mystique had a great deal of influence and received a great deal of information from SHIELD. She ran an operation at the Jean Grey School that allowed two agents on MGH to infiltrate the school pretending to be mutant students. Their job was to assess the student body as threats to determine their threat level. The plan was discovered and foiled by the students.<\/p><h3>Return to the X-Men<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4331051-t-008_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4331051\" data-ratio=\"1.7472118959108\" data-width=\"269\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 269px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:174.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4331051-t-008_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4331051\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11119\/111191377\/4331051-t-008_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11119\/111191377\/4331051-t-008_copy.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Ali was finally discovered and freed by Magneto, who had returned to Madripoor to put an end to MGH distribution. He helped Ali leave and returned with her to JGS, where Scott's team and Storm's team were under attack. When the helicarrier began open firing on the school, Mystique-Dazzler left the scene, even as Maria Hill ordered her to return. Hill then ordered her other agents to shoot Agent Dazzler on sight, believing that she had some hand in the attack. Once the mess was cleared up, Hill ordered her agents to arrest the real Dazzler. Infuriated, Ali told Hill what had happened - that she, while on board a<em> S.H.I.E.L.D.<\/em> helicarrier was drugged and kidnapped. Hill apologized and told her agents to stand down. She asked Dazzler to join her once again. This time, Ali refused, saying that the whole affair just served to remind her of where she really belongs - with the X-Men. She left JGS with Scott's team, and returned the Weapon X facility in the Canadian wilderness. Emma Frost, Magik, Scott, and Magneto returned to Madripoor with Ali so that she could seek out Mystique, who'd already left the area. When they returned to the facility, Ali decided to crop a large portion of her hair off, and to dye the tips of her mohawk black. She then adopted a darker outfit and attitude, more befitting of her current state of mind and the revolutionary antics of Scott's team.<\/p><h3>The Last Will and Testament of Charles Xavier<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4331055-t-008_copy+%281%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4331055\" data-ratio=\"0.28260869565217\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:28.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11119\/111191377\/4331055-t-008_copy+%281%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4331055\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11119\/111191377\/4331055-t-008_copy+%281%29.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11119\/111191377\/4331055-t-008_copy+%281%29.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Out For Blood<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Some time after Charles Xavier's passing, his last will and testament were given to Jennifer Walters, aka the Sensational She-Hulk, to read to the involved parties.

Scott, along with Magik, Kitty Pryde, Emma, and Ali teleported to JGS to hear the will with the other X-Men. It was revealed that Xavier had married Mystique. The revelation shocked and appalled everyone - except Emma, who flew into a fit of laughter when she heard. Despite Mystique's newly-revealed relationship to Charles Xavier, Ali still promised that she'd kill Mystique with her bare hands. When Hank asked her to return to the Jean Grey School to teach, rather than at the New Charles Xavier School for Mutants with Cyclops, Ali stated that she was just too angry - she needed a fight, and she was going to find it. Ali remained at JGS with Emma and Kitty while Magik and Cyclops left with the others to find and deal with the omnipotent mutant, Matthew Malloy, that Xavier informed them of in his will.<\/p><h2>Powers<\/h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-832949\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/36633\/832949-411_18.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.58039215686275\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/36633\/832949-411_18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-832949\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/36633\/832949-411_18.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/36633\/832949-411_18.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Dazzler<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Dazzler is a mutant with the ability to transduce sound into light.

She had an on-and-off romantic relationship with the world-renowned soldier-of-fortune named <a href=\"..\/..\/paladin\/29-10584\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Paladin<\/a>. Tragedy struck when a deadly <a href=\"\/aliens\/4015-46567\" data-ref-id=\"4015-46567\"> alien<\/a> called a <a href=\"..\/..\/kosmosians\/29-13985\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Kosmosian<\/a> was brought to <a href=\"\/earth\/4020-57183\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\"> Earth<\/a> as a result of one of her father's experiments, and the elder Van Dyne was murdered by the alien. A grieving Janet then contacted her father's colleague, Dr. <a href=\"..\/..\/hank-pym\/29-2247\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Henry Pym<\/a>. She told Pym of her resolve to bring her father's killer to justice. Pym, who was attracted to Janet and anxious to help, revealed his secret identity as Ant-Man and offered to give her similar powers. Janet underwent an advanced biochemical process involving his <a href=\"..\/..\/pym-particles\/12-42077\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Pym Particles<\/a> that allowed her to shrink to insect-sized proportions and to grow translucent insect wings. Furthermore, Pym outfitted her with personalized wrist devices which allowed her to discharge bio-electric energy blasts which she called her \"wasp stings.\" Designing a colorful costume for herself (the first of many), Janet Van Dyne became the superheroine known as the Wasp.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p style=\"\">The Wasp was originally created in 1963 by <a href=\"..\/..\/stan-lee\/26-40467\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Stan Lee<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/jack-kirby\/26-5614\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Jack Kirby<\/a> as a sidekick and love interest for <a href=\"..\/..\/hank-pym\/29-2247\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Hank Pym<\/a>, who at the time went by his Ant-Man persona in <a href=\"..\/..\/tales-to-astonish\/49-2008\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Tales to Astonish<\/a>. Her first appearances was in this series in issue #44. The Wasp became a founding member of the <a href=\"\/avengers\/4060-3806\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\"> Avengers<\/a> and its first female member, as well as the character credited with naming the team.<\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><p style=\"\">She was created by her husbands discovery of the PYM particle which enables a human to shrink into an different size. The Wasp held true to a pattern common among <a href=\"\/silver-age-of-comics\/4015-55821\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55821\"> Silver Age<\/a> female characters. This was demonstrated in one of two ways. She was generally demonstrated as dependent on her male partner (Hank Pym) for all of her super-abilities, and was mostly incapable of her own scientific understanding and ability. This extended as well to her playing the damsel-in-distress role from time-to-time, also a common trait among female characters in the silver age. As was also common for the period, her early appearances featured a somewhat standoffish attitude to those around her because of her wealthy upbringing. Later, as the Wasp was incorporated into the mainstream monthly activities of her superhero team, her mostly stereotypical behaviour disappeared, to be replaced by that of a strong ally and loyal teammate. As comics aimed to become less light and to appeal to an older audience in the 1980's and 1990's, her character underwent further change to make her more realistic, as well as deal with modern social issues (in Janet's case, with domestic abuse).<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Founding the Avengers<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-825034\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/37015\/825034-wasp1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.89318181818182\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/37015\/825034-wasp1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-825034\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/37015\/825034-wasp1.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Janet's original Wasp costume<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Using their superpowers, Jan and Hank tracked down and defeated the Kosmosian who had murdered Jan's father, banishing the alien to its home dimension. After sharing more adventures, <a href=\"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/hank-pym\/4005-2247\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hank<\/a> and Jan gradually fell in love with each other; Jan reminded Hank of his deceased first wife, Maria. Pym and Van Dyne became crime-fighting partners in their costumed identities, and became two of the founding members of the <a href=\"..\/..\/avengers\/65-3806\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Avengers<\/a> (along with <a href=\"..\/..\/thor\/29-2268\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Thor<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/iron-man\/29-1455\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Iron Man<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/hulk\/29-2267\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> The Hulk<\/a>) after responding when Hank's helmet picked up <a href=\"..\/..\/rick-jones\/29-2248\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Rick Jones<\/a> fateful call for help. It was, in fact, the Wasp who suggested the name \"Avengers\" for the group which had gathered. A further milestone in Avengers history, Jan and the other founders (minus the Hulk) were the discoverers of the great World War II hero, <a href=\"..\/..\/captain-america\/29-1442\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Captain America<\/a>, still frozen since the last days of the war. Being a fashion designer, the Wasp would become known for her frequent costume changes.<\/p><p style=\"\">Jan's attitude towards crime-fighting was, at first, very carefree, and she did a lot of flirting with other members of the team, especially Thor. She saw it as her way of attracting Hank's attention for his failure to commit. The studious Pym began to experiment with Pym Particles, and found that he could cause himself to grow beyond his normal height. By this time both crime fighters had been exposed to the Particles long enough to change size at will rather than rely on gas capsules or potions, and Jan could fire her stinger blasts without the aid of wrist devices. Changing his costumed identity to \" <a href=\"..\/..\/giant-man\/29-7216\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Giant-Man<\/a>,\" Pym eventually experienced bodily strain due to the physiological effects of the growing process. Because of this, Pym decided to take a break from costumed adventuring. With the stress of constant threats from Pym's enemies (such as <a href=\"..\/..\/egghead\/29-3797\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Egghead<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/whirlwind\/29-6828\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Whirlwind<\/a>) as well as confronting <a href=\"..\/..\/kang-the-conqueror\/29-13756\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Kang the Conqueror<\/a> and the <a href=\"..\/..\/masters-of-evil\/65-7582\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Masters of Evil<\/a> with the Avengers, Jan was ready for a break herself. Meanwhile, Thor and Iron Man took leaves of absence from the Avengers, leaving Captain America to preside over a new incarnation of the team. Jan remained in her civilian career as a fashion designer, with Pym continuing his scientific pursuits. Sometime later, however, Pym and Van Dyne learned that the <a href=\"..\/..\/namor\/29-1476\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Namor the Sub-Mariner<\/a> was heading for <a href=\"..\/..\/new-york-city\/34-41183\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> New York City<\/a>. Fearing trouble, they decided to alert the Avengers. The Wasp was captured first by Namor's foe, the undersea barbarian leader <a href=\"..\/..\/attuma\/29-15779\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Attuma<\/a>, and then by the <a href=\"..\/..\/collector\/29-13987\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Collector<\/a>. In order to help the Avengers rescue Janet, Pym decided to use his growing power again; he donned a new costume and adopted the new name of \"Goliath.\"<\/p><h3>A Rocky Marriage<\/h3><p style=\"\">Pym had always loved Janet, but various inhibitions kept him from proposing to her -- feelings of inadequacy due to her wealth were primary among them. One day, while he had still not fully mentally recovered from the stress of accidentally creating one of the Avengers' greatest foes in the form of the robot <a href=\"..\/..\/ultron\/29-2242\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Ultron<\/a>, Hank had a lab accident with experimental gases. These caused a reaction in him that broke this inhibitions down, and induced a severe case of schizophrenia. This was his second breakdown, the first having been after his first wife, Maria, had been killed. Believing himself to be a new person named \"Yellowjacket,\" Pym broke into <a href=\"..\/..\/avengers-mansion\/34-41036\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Avengers Mansion<\/a> and told the team that he had killed Henry Pym. When the team attacked him, he captured the Wasp and escaped. Soon after, the Avengers were shocked to hear that Janet, who suspected it was Pym all along, was going to marry him. Their wedding at Avengers Mansion was attended by a who's-who of active superheroes at the time. Immediately following, the Avengers were attacked by the villainous <a href=\"..\/..\/circus-of-crime\/65-23035\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Circus of Crime<\/a>. Janet later felt guilty at having taken advantage of Hank's mental state to finally get married, but the couple was initially happy.<\/p><h3>Jocasta<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-750157\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11352\/750157-6a00cdf3ac0c23cb8f00e398ea1b340004_500pi.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0660980810235\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:106.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11352\/750157-6a00cdf3ac0c23cb8f00e398ea1b340004_500pi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-750157\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11352\/750157-6a00cdf3ac0c23cb8f00e398ea1b340004_500pi.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11352\/750157-6a00cdf3ac0c23cb8f00e398ea1b340004_500pi.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Janet being used as a template for Jocasta<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Hank later had a third breakdown, during which he was captured and brainwashed by an upgraded version of Ultron, causing him to revert to his earliest days as Ant-Man. Ultron then sent Hank back to Avengers Mansion to attack his own teammates. During the fighting, it was the Wasp who took down her wayward husband. Undeterred, Ultron attacked the Avengers and captured the Wasp, with the intention of using her brain patterns as a template for his female robotic 'bride,' <a href=\"..\/..\/jocasta\/29-3318\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Jocasta<\/a>. However, Ultron underestimated the heroic influence that Janet's personality would have on his creation. Once animated with the Wasp's brain patterns, Jocasta contacted the Avengers, who arrived in time to rescue Janet and defeat Ultron.<\/p><p style=\"\">With Ultron's defeat Hank's brainwashing was reversed, but Janet suspected that this episode, culminating in being brought down by his own wife, may have further exacerbated her husband's already fragile mental state. He became overbearing, paranoid, and verbally abusive, releasing pent-up tension resultant of his sense of failure in science, made worse when compared to his wife's financial success.<\/p><h3>Divorce<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1994839\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101073\/1994839-smackthatbitch.png\" data-ratio=\"0.84736842105263\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:84.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101073\/1994839-smackthatbitch.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1994839\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101073\/1994839-smackthatbitch.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101073\/1994839-smackthatbitch.png\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The blow that ended the marriage<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">When the Avengers were battling the <a href=\"..\/..\/elfqueen\/29-32596\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Elfqueen<\/a>, Hank blasted the villainess from behind during a lull in the fighting, even though Captain America had nearly succeeded in talking her down. Rather than ending the struggle, Hank's unnecessary attack provoked yet another round of fighting. Afterward, Captain America charged Hank with reckless behavior, since innocent bystanders could have been killed.<\/p><p style=\"\">Cap's reprimand led to Pym's fourth nervous breakdown. An increasingly unstable Pym decided that if he could build a robot to attack Avengers Mansion, he could then defeat it and be a hero again in the eyes of his teammates. He included a special hidden weak spot on the robot just for this purpose. When Jan discovered Hank's plan and protested, Hank lashed out, brutally striking his wife. His plan went awry, and when the robot attacked the mansion, it was the Wasp who disabled it. In the following court-martial, Pym was stripped of his Avengers membership. Meanwhile, Janet decided that she had had enough and filed for divorce.<\/p><h3>Continued Avengers Service and Chairmanship<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3072324\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/119688\/3072324-kurtura.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"2.0371517027864\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:203.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/119688\/3072324-kurtura.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3072324\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/119688\/3072324-kurtura.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/119688\/3072324-kurtura.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Team leader<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Over the years, Janet had become a seasoned hero, a far cry from the ditzy thrill-seeker she had been when first teaming with Pym. She continued service with the team after Hank's fourth breakdown despite the tremendous stress of the situation. After the divorce, she at times revisited her old dallying romance with <a href=\"..\/..\/paladin\/29-10584\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Paladin<\/a>. The Wasp was elected as chairman of the Avengers, a position she held for a long time (second to only Captain America), having been molded into a savvy and capable leader. Janet and several other Avengers were among the group of heroes summoned to <a href=\"..\/..\/battleworld\/34-51065\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Battleworld<\/a> by the <a href=\"..\/..\/beyonder\/29-10300\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Beyonder<\/a> to fight in his <a href=\"..\/..\/secret-wars\/39-40978\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Secret Wars<\/a>.

Her teammate <a href=\"..\/..\/black-knight\/29-3172\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Black Knight<\/a> had an unrequited crush on her for some time, while another, the Greek god <a href=\"..\/..\/hercules\/29-2503\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Hercules<\/a>, chafed at being given orders by a woman. The most serious test of her leadership ability came when the <a href=\"..\/..\/masters-of-evil\/65-7582\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Masters of Evil<\/a> under <a href=\"..\/..\/baron-helmut-zemo\/29-3278\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Baron Zemo<\/a> attacked and conquered Avengers Mansion in the <a href=\"..\/..\/avengers-under-siege\/39-55966\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Under Siege<\/a> story arc. With every other active team member incapacitated and a small army of super-villains holding their headquarters, it was up to The Wasp to assemble a rescue squad and mount the assault to retake the mansion. Eventually Hank Pym's mental balance returned and he was reinstated as an active Avenger. Janet was briefly assigned to the West Coast branch after this. The two managed to rekindle a friendship and, some years later, a romance. While on a trip to Las Vegas, however, Jan turned down a proposal of Hank's; she said she would not marry him again.<\/p><h3>The Crossing and Onslaught<\/h3><p style=\"\">After sustaining severe injuries during the <a href=\"..\/..\/avengers-the-crossing\/39-48424\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <i>Crossing<\/i><\/a>, Pym put Janet through the same process that he had originally used to give her her powers. This temporarily mutated Janet into an almost completely wasp-like form. In this form, she was among the Avengers who seemingly gave their lives to absorb the energy of <a href=\"..\/..\/onslaught\/29-13352\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Onslaught<\/a>, in reality being shunted to an alternate dimension.

Janet hosted the television show \"America's Next Superstar\" for a time. Jan then had a dallying affair with <a href=\"..\/..\/clint-barton\/29-1475\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Hawkeye<\/a> after he re-joined the Avengers, which left Hank reeling. She soon returned to her longtime, if rocky, flame. Around this time, Jan also began using Pym Particles to grow to immense heights, just as Hawkeye (as Goliath) and Pym had done.<\/p><h3>Avengers Disassembled<\/h3><p style=\"\">One day at the pool, while discussing her fling with Hawkeye and the Scarlet Witch, a slightly tipsy Wasp confessed to a pregnancy scare and inadvertently mentioned Wanda's own children, whose unnatural existence <a href=\"..\/..\/agatha-harkness\/29-3327\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Agatha Harkness<\/a> had erased from the Witch's memory. The Wasp's slip of the tongue, combined with Scarlet Witch's increasingly unstable and growing powers caused Wanda to suffer a mental breakdown which lead to the events of ' <a href=\"..\/..\/avengers-disassembled\/39-43625\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Avengers Disassembled<\/a>'. Janet was knocked into a coma by a rampaging She-Hulk during an attack on Avengers Mansion by the Scarlet Witch. Hank watched over her as she laid in the hospital, and when she recovered, they reconciled. The two retired from the Avengers in order to pursue a new life together in Oxford.

Janet was also pro-registration (although she was very upset about the murder of her friend <a href=\"..\/..\/goliath\/29-3470\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Bill Foster<\/a>) and had become the host of a pro-registration reality show called <i>America's Newest Superhero<\/i>. When selecting the roster for the latest incarnation of the Avengers team, this time as part of the Fifty States Initiative, Tony Stark selected Janet as a founding member of the <a href=\"..\/..\/mighty-avengers\/65-46148\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Mighty Avengers<\/a>. When alien symbiotes attacked New York, Janet used a refined growth formula given to her by Hank Pym which allowed her to shift to giant-size without side effects. It was later revealed, however, that Hank had been replaced by a <a href=\"..\/..\/skrulls\/65-40668\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Skrull<\/a> impostor by at that point, so it was possible that some flaw had deliberately put in the formula.

She was later seen with the rest of the Avengers heading to New York to confront more invading Skrulls. While fighting the Skrulls, the true sinister purpose of the serum that the Skrull Hank Pym gave her was revealed. After the Skrull <a href=\"..\/..\/queen-veranke\/29-54514\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Queen Veranke<\/a> was shot and killed, Skrull Pym activated a button that made Jan increase in size, very rapidly. Jan realized that the particles Pym had given her in earlier were now turning her into a bio-bomb. Jan was seen growing huge and emitting a black-purple matter in a precursor to an explosion. Knowing she was about to die, she tried to flee the battlefield and take as many Skrulls with her as she could. In order to save countless innocent people, Thor was forced to teleport Jan to another dimension before she could explode, vowing to avenge her in the process.<\/p><h3>Post-Secret Invasion<\/h3><p style=\"\">After the death of Janet Van Dyne, the real Hank Pym was discovered to be a captive on board one of the Skrull starships, along with many other missing heroes who had been replaced by Skrull impostors. Much to Hank's shock, he learned that his former wife had been used as a Skrull weapon in the invasion. Earth's heroes then had to break the news to Hank that Janet had died as a result.<\/p><p style=\"\">The news devastated Hank, and for a while he went into seclusion in his lab. After he re-emerged, he decided to honor the woman he regarded as 'the greatest hero he had ever known' by taking up the hero's mantle again and creating a new alter ego for himself: the Wasp.<\/p><h3>Afterlife Appearances<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1164319\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15776\/1164319-wasp.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.7643064985451\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:176.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15776\/1164319-wasp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1164319\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15776\/1164319-wasp.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15776\/1164319-wasp.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The celestial entity mistaken for Wasp<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Shortly after her death, it seemed that Janet's soul-spirit was encountered by her former Avengers teammate <a href=\"..\/..\/hercules\/29-2503\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Hercules<\/a> when he journeyed to the underworld. Since Janet felt as though she still had unfinished business among the living, her spirit was shown trapped in the dimension of Erebus and relentlessly attempting to gamble her way back into the living world. It was noted that the gambling games that the trapped souls played in Erebus in search of their release had the odds of a win stacked overwhelmingly against them, though these odds did not deter Janet from playing.<\/p><p style=\"\">Meanwhile, Hank Pym discovered a massive and seemingly female celestial entity in the alternate dimension of Underspace while experimenting with dimensional technology. The entity featured a pattern on her body that strongly resembled the Wasp costume Janet last wore when she exploded, so Hank become convinced the entity was in fact Janet herself. Hank established an extradimensional headquarters called the <a href=\"..\/..\/infinite-avengers-mansion\/34-56336\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Infinite Avengers Mansion<\/a> in the location of one of the entity's \"eyes.\" He designed the Infinite Mansion to act as a dimensional \"harness\" to keep her particles from drifting apart completely, and then began work on a device that would restore her to human form. But one of Hank's young <a href=\"\/avengers-academy\/4060-57354\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57354\"> Avengers Academy<\/a> members, <a href=\"\/veil\/4005-69916\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69916\"> Veil<\/a>, grew desperate to make a good impression on Hank and decided to trigger the device prematurely in an attempt to bring Janet back.

Hank Pym had transferred Janet's memories into Carina's energy form when he thought she was his late wife. The memories inspires Carina to live by her own wishes and not her father or husband's.<\/p><p style=\"\">Meanwhile, a version of Janet's psyche still lives on in the robotic form of Jocasta, though Jocasta has developed her own feelings for Hank. Jocasta, now an honorary Avenger and Hank's assistant, has grown increasingly distraught by Hank's obsession with bringing Janet back.

She is able to shrink to a minimum of half an inch or grow to a maximum of several hundred feet. Smaller or larger sizes are possible but the exertion begins to put a strain on her body. Initially, these abilities stemmed from use of a Pym particle gas released from special capsules. Over time, however, her body has absorbed enough particles to allow her to alter her size at will.<\/p><p style=\"\">At miniature size, her strength level increases as her body's mass is compacted. At giant size, her strength and endurance increase geometrically with her height, reaching superhuman levels. Despite the advantages of giant size, Janet usually prefers to remain the diminutive Wasp, calling on her growth power only in times of extreme emergency. At miniature size, the Wasp grows a pair of translucent insect wings from her back, a result of genetic modifications provided by Hank Pym. These grant her the power of flight, at incredible speeds.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Wasp is able to harness and augment her body's natural bio-electric energy, releasing it from her hands in powerful electrical bursts, which she calls her \"stinger blasts\" or \"wasp stings.\" Originally, she required special wrist devices to produce these but again, Pym particle absorption has allowed her to create the ability unaided. The Wasp's genetic modifications also grant her the ability to sprout small prehensile antennae from her forehead which allow her to telepathically communicate with and control insects. However, this is an ability that she rarely uses.<\/p><p style=\"\">Janet Van Dyne has also displayed several non-superhuman abilities that have garnered her special fame and attention, foremost of which is her fashion sense. She possesses considerable talent as a clothing and costume designer, and in her early appearances she showcased many different costumes, all designed and created herself. She also helped her Avengers teammate <a href=\"..\/..\/ms-marvel\/29-21561\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Ms. Marvel<\/a> create her own signature costume.<\/p><p style=\"\">In addition, the Wasp is one of the most intuitive and deductive members of the Avengers. She effectively deduced that a chemical accident had created a schizophrenic break in Henry Pym. She was the first Avenger to realize that the relationship between the Scarlet Witch and the <a href=\"..\/..\/vision\/29-1504\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Vision<\/a> was the result of the infused personality of <a href=\"..\/..\/wonder-man\/29-1465\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Wonder Man<\/a>, and also was the first to correctly guess the identity of Iron Man at a time when Tony Stark faked his own death.<\/p><p style=\"\">As a founding member of the Avengers, the Wasp has learned a great deal by fighting alongside veteran heroes like Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, and many others, and has grown into a strong and capable leader in her own right. She has served both as field leader and as chairwoman of the team many times during her Avengers tenure.<\/p><h2>Personal Data<\/h2><ul><li><b>Height<\/b> (normal): 5' 4\"<\/li><li><b>Weight<\/b> (normal): 110 lbs (50 kg)<\/li><li><b>Eyes<\/b>: Blue<\/li><li><b>Hair<\/b>: Auburn<\/li><li><b>Unusual features<\/b>: Translucent wasp-like wings sprout from Janet's back when she shrinks to under 4 feet tall.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\"><i><b>Status<\/b><\/i><\/p><ul><li><b>Citizenship<\/b>: American<\/li><li><b>Place of Birth<\/b>: Cresskill, New Jersey<\/li><li><b>Marital Status<\/b>: Divorced<\/li><li><b>Occupations<\/b>: Avenger, adventurer, television show host, fashion designer, independently wealthy socialite<\/li><li><b>Known Relatives<\/b>: <a href=\"\/vernon-van-dyne\/4005-66815\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66815\"> Vernon Van Dyne<\/a> (father, deceased), Dr. <a href=\"\/hank-pym\/4005-2247\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\"> Henry Pym<\/a> (husband, divorced), <a href=\"\/ultron\/4005-2242\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\"> Ultron<\/a> (self-declared 'son'), <a href=\"\/jocasta\/4005-3318\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3318\"> Jocasta<\/a> (first 'daughter-in-law'), <a href=\"\/alkhema\/4005-19946\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19946\"> Alkhema<\/a> (second 'daughter-in-law'), <a href=\"\/vision\/4005-1504\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\"> Vision<\/a> ('grandson'), <a href=\"\/scarlet-witch\/4005-1466\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\"> Scarlet Witch<\/a> (former 'granddaughter-in-law')<\/li><\/ul><h2>Alternate Realities<\/h2><h3>Earth-1610<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4965993-5517610363-Ultim.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4965993\" data-ratio=\"1.0927601809955\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:109.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4965993-5517610363-Ultim.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4965993\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4965993-5517610363-Ultim.JPG\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4965993-5517610363-Ultim.JPG\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ultimate Wasp<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In the <a href=\"..\/..\/ultimate-universe\/12-40390\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Ultimate Universe<\/a>, Janet is of Asian descent, rather than Caucasian, and she is a scientific genius in her own right, holding 2 PhDs.

Her mutant powers allows her to shrink and grow wings when she is shrunken. She can also produce energy blasts which act like wasp stings. Her powers have strange side effects however, which include causing her to eat insects, forming her own larval nests, and laying eggs. She started dating Hank during college, but even during college Hank was extremely abusive to her. She was a roommate of <a href=\"..\/..\/betty-ross\/29-3445\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Betty Ross<\/a>, and Betty remembers times where Janet was missing chunks of her hair.<\/p><p style=\"\">Their relationship would not change in time though. Hank tried to improve his behavior with medication and joining the <a href=\"..\/..\/ultimates\/65-40504\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Ultimates<\/a> program. Janet also became good friends with Captain America, which made Hank jealous. After a humiliating loss to the Hulk, he took out his frustration on Janet. He started attacking Janet, which caused her to change size and start firing wasp-blasts at him. Hank got even more angry and ordered his ants to attack Janet. The swarm of ants began biting the wasp-sized Janet, and she was left in a coma due to the ant attack. After Captain tracked down Hank and beat him to a pulp for what he did to Janet, he went to visit her. Janet became outraged at Captain for beating Hank and was embarrassed at people talking about her personal life. However, after they finished a mission, Janet and Captain reconciled and would slowly develop a romantic relationship. When Hank came back to reconcile with her, Janet refused. However, Janet would tell Hank about her relationship problems with Captain, stating that his age gap and the friends he hung out with made it hard for her to connect. Janet would continue to see Hank secretively. Later, when the Liberators attacked America, they failed to take Janet into account. By the time they found her she had already freed Captain America, who was being held captive at the <a href=\"..\/..\/triskelion\/34-55727\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Triskelion<\/a>. She and Cap later met up with <a href=\"..\/..\/nick-fury\/29-3202\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Nick Fury<\/a> and Betty Ross and helped free the President.

Wasp joins her king and their few other combat ready heroes in attempting to repel the evil zombies; constantly imploring them that she can help them to conquer their blood-lust as she has cured herself of it; but falling upon deaf ears. In one of these conflicts, Wasp's robotic body is damaged and while she is being repaired by Reynolds, Reynolds reveals his romantic feelings for her and the two share a kiss that shocks and appalls all onlookers, human and zombie alike. In the next battle, Wasp's robotic body is destroyed and she is presumed dead. Reynolds, who had fallen in love with her and is despondent due to her apparent demise sacrifices himself by allowing himself to be eaten by a rampaging zombie Hulk; banking on that if Hulk's hunger is sated, he will revert to Banner. Reynold's sacrifice pays off and, once Hulk has reverted to Banner, Banner allows himself to be killed for the greater good before he can become the Hulk again. By this point, the last remaining power cosmic empowered zombies have stopped feeling their hunger pangs and they all try to band together to help the humans. During the cleanup and repair efforts on the human compound, Wasp's head is discovered, still \"alive\". She is given either a new robotic body or an unused older model to get by with. She mourns for Reynolds and reveals to her long ago husband Giant Man that Reynolds was the greatest man she had ever known. Shortly thereafter, Wasp, along with the few other remaining zombies is tricked by Cortez and is teleported to another dimension.<\/p><h3>Earth-20051<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-149099\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/149099-73158-giant-girl.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5175\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/149099-73158-giant-girl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-149099\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/149099-73158-giant-girl.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/149099-73158-giant-girl.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Janet Van Dyne as Giant Girl<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The <i>Marvel Adventures: The Avengers<\/i> series (set in its own continuity) features Janet Van Dyne as <a href=\"..\/..\/giant-girl\/29-41570\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Giant Girl<\/a>, showcasing her ability to grow rather than shrink, which she uses most frequently in combat. She is younger than her main universe counterpart and she cracks jokes along with her teammate <a href=\"..\/..\/spider-man\/29-1443\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Spider-Man<\/a>. Issue 13 of the series reveals her origin as a wealthy socialite given access to size-changing Pym particles by scientist Henry Pym (here an employee of Janet's father, rather than a superhero). Janet does not appear to have ever used her Wasp identity in this version. It has been revealed that Janet can shrink to wasp size but, unlike in Marvel's main reality, she sees no point in being tiny. Her maximum size is unknown but she has grown tall enough to catch a school. Instead of having her powers naturally, Janet requires a suit powered by Pym particles to change her size. Like her Earth-616 counterpart, Janet seems to change her costume regularly. Originally she wore a skin-tight full body suit that accurately accentuates all her curves along with her muscles and primarily purple with some blue costume with a mask that was similar to that of Giant-Man. It included the antennae (although she never used them). They left her vulnerable to insect mind control as seen in issue 13. Her second costume was primarily blue with some purple set in a v-pattern from her waist running all the way to her posterior regions and lacks a mask or antennae. A recent preview of Marvel Adventures the Avengers 19 has shown her wearing a costume which is primarily blue but has gold\/yellow. Whether this costume increases her maximum size is yet to be seen. She has also mentioned that she has at least two brothers although they have never been seen or given any names (see Marvel Adventures the Avengers #3).<\/p><h3>Earth-982<\/h3><p style=\"\">In the MC2 universe (an alternate future timeline), the marriage between Janet Van Dyne and Hank Pym was more successful and they had a son and a daughter.

Her parents would furiously argue with each other, traumatizing her as an infant. Abused as a child, one day when a hand (possibly her father\u2019s) reached into her crib the first of her multiple personalities manifested itself in a wild, clawing rage that lashed out. Mary was found to have telepathic, telekinetic and pyrokinetic abilities and was taken away and institutionalized. Her persona as Mary was gentle and cooperative, but weak and prone to seizures and other disorders. Her second identity was uncontrollable and murderous, and constantly ran a fever, giving rise to her name: Typhoid. While in the institution, she was trained in her telepathy, but also experimented on and abused.<\/p><p style=\"\">Eventually she escaped and woke up one morning to find herself in a hotel room with rope burns and a bruised lip; as Mary, she was totally unaware of what had happened while as her other persona(e). Mary tried to become an actress and was good at it but this was short-lived and she disappeared.<\/p><p style=\"\">Re-emerging as a prostitute working in a brothel and going by the name Lyla, <a href=\"\/daredevil\/4005-24694\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil<\/a> (Matt Murdock) came across her while on the hunt for one of <a href=\"\/roscoe-sweeney\/4005-16830\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16830\">the Fixer\u2019s<\/a> associates.

Enlisting a mugger called Rip as her accomplice, she killed a group of drug dealers for their money. In Hell's Kitchen she proceeded to do the same to various criminal operations belonging to <a href=\"\/kingpin\/4005-1483\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">the Kingpin<\/a>, to the extent that the New York press approved of her and the police tolerated her activities. As Typhoid had become a noticeable annoyance for the Kingpin and upon hearing that she was an alluring woman, he researches her and senses the perfect opportunity to bring down Daredevil and satisfy his own inner desires, inviting her to his building and offering her a million dollars to play a cruel game with Daredevil by charming him as Mary Walker and tormenting him as Typhoid. Mary manipulated her way into Matt's affections by pretending to help a young blind man named Tyrone Janson. Typhoid's apparent sickness and delirium inducing abilities along with a completely different voice, scent and changed personality kept Daredevil's super senses from determining that Mary Walker and Typhoid were the same person when she attacked him later as Typhoid. Her behavior came across to Matt as disgusting. While Matt's relationship with Mary grew, behind the scenes Typhoid was manipulating the court case involving the criminal who blinded Tyrone. Matt was successful in convicting the criminal, but Typhoid continued to try to break Matt, while at the same time keeping the Kingpin satisfied. Typhoid and Mary struggled for control of her mind as Mary's feelings for Matt gave her strength to resist Typhoid's power. When the Kingpin's skepticism in her ability to stay as typhoid reaches the point of physical abuse, while being frustrated that she couldn't have Matt and that Mary wouldn't allow her to harm him personally, Typhoid sends the Wildboys with <a href=\"\/ammo\/4005-29689\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29689\">Ammo<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/bullet\/4005-3125\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3125\">Bullet<\/a> and <a href=\"\/bushwacker\/4005-11932\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11932\">Bushwacker<\/a> after Daredevil. The villains batter Matt before Typhoid drops him off a bridge. Without making sure Matt was dead, she informs the Kingpin of the good news.<\/p><p style=\"\">The demon invasion of New York in <a href=\"\/inferno\/4045-41408\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41408\">Inferno<\/a> then begins. Mary regains control of her mind and ponders committing suicide to defeat Typhoid for good. Finding Matt's broken body, she approaches but a demon attack allows Typhoid to briefly retake control. Mary eventually brings Matt to the hospital and tells him about her true nature as Typhoid Mary. When Matt wakes up, his girlfriend Karen is present but he calls out for Mary instead, breaking her heart. Typhoid Mary returns to the Kingpin to inform him that Matt is still alive, but doesn't tell him that it was Mary who saved him.<\/p><h3>Acts of Vengeance<\/h3><p style=\"\">When <a href=\"\/loki\/4005-4324\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki<\/a> gathers a group of supervillains together to attack <a href=\"\/avengers\/4060-3806\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">the Avengers<\/a> and other Marvel heroes in <a href=\"\/acts-of-vengeance\/4045-41931\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41931\">Acts of Vengeance<\/a>, <a href=\"\/doctor-doom\/4005-1468\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr Doom<\/a> enlists Typhoid Mary to steal the secrets of <a href=\"\/kymellians\/4060-52945\" data-ref-id=\"4060-52945\">Kymellian<\/a> technology from <a href=\"\/james-power\/4005-59657\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59657\">Dr James Power.<\/a> This brings her into conflict with <a href=\"\/power-pack\/4060-40498\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40498\">Power Pack<\/a> and their friend <a href=\"\/dagger\/4005-1935\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1935\">Dagger<\/a>.

Mary and Wolverine break into a facility belonging to The Project and find some videotapes. The tapes show evidence of The Project performing psychic surgery on people, making them into assassins but while they watch at Mary\u2019s house, her own painful memories trigger Typhoid to re-emerge. Wolverine tries to talk Mary back into control but Typhoid sets him on fire and flees. Typhoid goes back to The Project and forces a surgeon to reprogram another doctor to hate the things he loves. Wolvie arrives and Typhoid reminds him that he too was reprogrammed in his past. Wolverine manages to get Mary back in control despite being set on fire, but while he goes to interrogate the surgeon, Typhoid takes over again and goes to the house of Sidney Joern, the head psychic surgeon of The Project. She kills his guards and blackmails him with evidence she has gathered of his misdoings. She wants him to do their experiments on her in reverse and <i>remove<\/i> her killer persona. However, as soon as she is hooked up to the equipment, Sidney decides instead to wipe her mind to stop her revealing his crimes to the public. Wolverine arrives and Typhoid Mary wakes up. Furious, she telekinetically straps Wolvie down and proceeds to kill all the surgeons before escaping. Wolvie is only able to bring Mary back briefly by kissing Typhoid before she is gone.<\/p><h3>Institutionalized Again<\/h3><p style=\"\">Typhoid Mary continued to operate as the Kingpin's enforcer and adviser. Daredevil, however, manages to have her committed for her own good by Social Services, but loses Mary's trust in doing so. She only pretends to take her medication and escapes, taking a job with the Women's Action Movement (WAM) at a shopping mall where she meets <a href=\"\/dan-ketch\/4005-14719\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14719\">Dan Ketch<\/a> (Ghost Rider). She is intrigued by Dan, but while in the bathroom a demon named <a href=\"\/dusk\/4005-43251\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43251\">Dusk<\/a> approaches her, offering to take away her Typhoid persona if she will drive Ghost Rider to madness for him.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/236886-57601-typhoid-mary.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236886\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.9867549668874\" data-width=\"302\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 302px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:198.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/236886-57601-typhoid-mary.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236886\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/236886-57601-typhoid-mary.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/236886-57601-typhoid-mary.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Versus Ghost Rider<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Returning to the mall, some corrupt security guards harrass and try to kiss Mary, provoking Typhoid to emerge and fight them. Dan turns into Ghost Rider and takes down Typhoid with his penance stare but is shocked when she turns back into Mary. Typhoid reasserts control and goes on the hunt for the guards. Finding Dan and his priest friend Louis Tarsitano she fights Dan and provokes him into transforming. The last remaining security guard shows up. When Typhoid kills him, Ghost Rider chokes her with his chain but is driven mad because he doesn't want to hurt Mary; this allows Dusk to transport Ghost Rider to his Realm of Insanity. Typhoid finds out that Dusk never intended to help her and enters the Realm as well, inadvertently leaving behind her sane persona as she does so. Dusk torments her with her worst fears and her feelings for the men in her life. Ghost Rider approaches but Typhoid refuses to listen to him and jumps off a cliff onto some spikes below. Ghost Rider and one of the WAM employees bring Typhoid back to reality, but as soon as she is re-joined with Mary she escapes home to take some drugs. Ghost Rider defeats Dusk meanwhile.<\/p><p style=\"\">While institutionalized again, her doctors note Typhoid Mary's identities fracture into a third persona. Wolverine breaks her out again so he can gain access to The Project facility again (now called The Fortress) to track down a mutant named Jessie Drake. Dr Hunt at the hospital had been trying to alter Mary's mind and Mary pleads with Wolverine to kill her but he refuses.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/47589\/1734713-typhoid_seduce.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1734713\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3739316239316\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/47589\/1734713-typhoid_seduce.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1734713\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/47589\/1734713-typhoid_seduce.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/47589\/1734713-typhoid_seduce.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Typhoid seduces Dr Hunt<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Mary is able to gain access to the Fortress as she appears to have no powers. Once in she switches to Typhoid and finds Jessie, but they are knocked out and captured as they try to escape. Jessie mentally calls out to Daredevil and <a href=\"\/vengeance\/4005-14759\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14759\">Vengeance<\/a> for help. Typhoid is then put in a sensory deprivation tank and confronted with her worst memories, which causes her to lash out with her telekinesis and pyrokinesis powers, killing all the males in the room but not the women. This creates a new persona for Typhoid: Bloody Mary, a violently misandrist (man-hating) woman, who telekinetically assembles a suit of armor for herself, frees Jessie and takes her to a women's shelter. However, there she finds out that Jessie is actually a man with the ability to transform according to people around her, hence becoming a woman. This drives Mary insane and she becomes Bloody Mary again and starts going after abusive men in the shelter's files. <a href=\"\/steel-raven\/4005-42949\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42949\">Steel Raven<\/a> is sent after Mary and Jessie by the Fortress. Steel Raven finds Mary but the two decide instead to go after the head scientist Dr Hoffner for his experimentation on children. Vengeance is unable to stop Mary, and neither are Wolverine and Daredevil (who doesn't recognize her as Bloody Mary) but when she bumps into Jessie again, Jessie somehow enables Mary to manifest a fourth identity: Walker, a stable and rational persona. When Wolverine reveals that Dr Hunt had only wanted to preserve the Typhoid persona for himself and kill the other identities, Walker goes to confront Dr. Hunt at the hospital. She then announces to the public her mission to go after and punish all men who have hurt women in any way.<\/p><h3>Spider-Man<\/h3><p style=\"\">Sadly failing to maintain her sanity, Bloody Mary begins another killing rampage against abusive men in New York. After the third murder, Bloody Mary reverts to ordinary Mary who tells the police that she witnessed it from a hidden spot in the room. <a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker<\/a> (Spider-Man) is in attendance as a reporter and invites Mary to dinner with him and <a href=\"\/mary-jane\/4005-13380\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\">MJ<\/a>. Flitting between her three different personalities, Typhoid Mary continues to go on a crusade against men, but Spider-Man, realizing that the three identities are one person, is able to stop her killing Jack Morray, an especially brutal man. Spidey convinces her to return to her Mary persona and she confesses her crimes and turns herself in.<\/p><h3>Private Investigator<\/h3><p style=\"\">Mary is placed at a halfway house and makes friends with a man named John. The Walker persona reasserts control, but allows Mary to come forth to meet with John. Mary learns about a series of murders of prostitutes. As Walker she poses as a private investigator and looks into the case. As the investigation progresses, Walker tries to make sense of the clues that the three other personae leave for her on post-it notes. The murders turn out to have been carried out by two policemen: Dick Richards and Evan Racette and also Ophelia Taranova, the wife of an ex-detective, Jack. Typhoid poses as a prostitute to catch Racette and kills him as Bloody Mary. However, she is kidnapped by Quince, Ophelia\u2019s son and his friend Trent who learned about Dr Hunt and his therapy videos of Mary. The two kids think they can cure her. Typhoid easily breaks free and learns from Jack that Ophelia is one of the murderers. Unable to accept a woman as her enemy she tracks down and kills Dick Richards as Bloody Mary, before returning to her P.I. job as Walker.<\/p><h3>Deadpool<\/h3><p style=\"\">Back in psychiatric care, Mary was still traumatized from her horrific life: she secretly hires the mercenary <a href=\"\/deadpool\/4005-7606\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool<\/a> to kill her, while at the same time Typhoid puts out a request to free her. Deadpool breaks her out, but since she lacks money to pay him for either of her requests (with Kingpin unreachable) Typhoid offers her 'other' talents instead. Deadpool instead decides she should work to pay off her debt. After a fight breaks out, Typhoid is knocked out of a window. This gives her a flashback to her origin and she decides they should go to New York to punish Daredevil. The two of them trap Daredevil and beat him up a bit, but when Daredevil refuses to feel remorse for creating Typhoid Mary she goes mad and falls to the floor. At this, Deadpool takes her away to a warehouse for some practical therapy. Typhoid tricks him and easily breaks free and goes off on another killing spree around New York. Deadpool catches her up with her and beats her up, but not before she has taunted him about his true brutal nature. Returning to Deadpool's <a href=\"\/the-hell-house\/4020-56238\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56238\">Hell house<\/a>, Typhoid disguises herself as <a href=\"\/banshee\/4005-3181\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3181\">Siryn<\/a>, seduces Deadpool and then leaves him, devastated.<\/p><p style=\"\">Mary reassumes control and works as an actress again, but the Kingpin shows up. When he hits her, the shock brings back the Typhoid personality and he hires her to assassinate Matt Murdock. Matt's bodyguards <a href=\"\/jessica-jones\/4005-2265\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2265\">Jessica Jones<\/a> and <a href=\"\/luke-cage\/4005-1450\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage<\/a> take care of her, but not before she causes severe burns on Matt.<\/p><h3>The Initiative<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/194740-41231-mutant-zero.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-194740\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5225\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/194740-41231-mutant-zero.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-194740\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/194740-41231-mutant-zero.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/194740-41231-mutant-zero.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Mutant Zero<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Typhoid Mary is imprisoned at <a href=\"\/the-raft\/4020-50736\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50736\">the Raft<\/a> but is broken out when <a href=\"\/electro\/4005-3228\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro<\/a> frees all the prisoners for Skrull-Elektra.

She claims to be fully in control of her personalities but he has doubts and puts her under guard in a tower. Eventually he releases her to work for him. After the defeat and disappearance of Daredevil, the Kingpin returns and reveals he knows of a keyword that will awaken a persona in Mary that will be loyal to him.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><ul><li>Telekinesis- can levitate small objects (those weighing less that 10 pounds)<\/li><li>Pyrokinesis- she has the power to set things in her immediate area aflame<\/li><li>Mind Control- she has the power to implant mental suggestions into unsuspecting minds as well as sedate weak-willed people and animals<\/li><li>She is also very skilled in martial arts and the use of weapons especially machetes.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Due to childhood abuse, Mary developed dissociative identity disorder, giving her (at first) three distinct personalities: timid Mary, lustful Typhoid, and vicious Bloody Mary. However, the differences between these are so great that not even highly sensitive individuals such as Daredevil and Wolverine can tell they are the same person, even her scent and heartbeat differ.<\/p><p style=\"\">As Mary, she rarely manifests her mutant abilities, although when threatened, she can unconsciously call upon all of her personalities at will and benefit from their powers and fighting skills, but Mary can not recall anything that Bloody or Typhoid do.<\/p><p style=\"\">When the Typhoid personality takes over, Mary gets a high fever as though she was sick, however she becomes far more athletic than timid Mary Walker. Typhoid seems to be the craziest and most lustful of all her personalities.<\/p><p style=\"\">Bloody Mary seems to be the strongest, most unstable and violent of the personalities. Bloody Mary says she only hurts men who hurt women: she sees herself as a feminist fighter that is fighting for the rights of women that can't protect themselves. The sexual lust that she displays as Typhoid is no longer present as Bloody Mary.<\/p><p style=\"\">Two other personalities have since shown themselves: Walker and Mutant Zero. Walker is more rational and capable than the other personae, but appears to lack the ability to use her mutant powers. Like Mary she cannot remember the things she does while in the other identities. Mutant Zero was able to use all her mutant powers, but had to return to frequent meditation. This identity appeared to break when her past as Typhoid Mary was revealed to her. She is an excellent shot and swordswoman.<\/p><h2>Other Media<\/h2><h3>Films<\/h3><h4>Elektra<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4592647-typhoid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4592647\" data-ratio=\"1.6722222222222\" data-width=\"180\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 180px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:167.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4592647-typhoid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4592647\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4592647-typhoid.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4592647-typhoid.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Typhoid in Elektra<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In the movie <a href=\"\/elektra\/4005-1802\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1802\">Elektra<\/a>, Typhoid Mary is one of The Hand Ninjas.

She appears in the later sagas of Elfquest. Unlike many \"cubs\" (the Wolfrider name for children) she was not born of naturally occurring Recognition. Leetah, the tribes healer, was asked by Redlance and Nightfall to try and use the amplification of the High One's Palace on her powers to force a fertile mating between the two. Nonetheless, Tyleet (ty = gift, leet = healer) is a special child with a special future.<\/p><p style=\"\">All of the elves are born with a special trait, and while Tyleet is not particularly fierce or crafty, she seems to carry an innate grace and tranquil spirit. Pike (the Woflriders storyteller) makes up a song about her \"Try to deny her anything!\" because she is so sweet it is impossible to tell her no. Tyleet's gentle nature and her tenacity coupled with her curiosity about and tolerance of humans indicates a mysterious destiny of diplomacy between elves and humans.<\/p><p style=\"\">In her tribe, it was a rule for elves to keep their distance from humans. But when Tyleet discovers an abandoned human child with a birthmark on his face (leading his birth-tribe to think him cursed, hence abandoning him), her motherly instincts (and long time desire for her own cub) led her to rescue him, She begged her tribe to accept him (try to deny her anything) and they let her bring \"Little Patch\" up as part of the Wolfriders until full grown. As a child he was stronger and clumsier compared to elf babes but in time was able to inherit Tyleet's wisdom. Other tribe members taught him various skills and crafts and he became as swift and graceful as his adoptive tribe. Eventually he found he couldn't mate with elf maidens (a distastrous attempt with the curious Aroree led him to discover that elfin \"bloodsong was pitched too high\") so he ingratiates himself into a local human tribe. He knows this means he cannot return to the Wolfriders so as not to expose them, but he finds a mate in the human tribe who is unafraid of his birthmark. He teaches them much of his forest lore and eventually becomes their chief. Tyleet takes great pride in her son and spies on his progress throughout his life, pleased at how he leads with grace and wisdom and has come to lead the tribe that once abandoned him to die in the forest. Finally, when he is elderly and addled, he runs into the forest calling for her, his mother, in elfin tongue and she breaks cover to come to him and hold him, singing to him as he dies smiling in her arms..<\/p><p style=\"\">Tyleet is Recognized (\"soul meets soul when eyes meet eyes\" - the binding of two elves souls and creation of an undeniable mating urge with the guarantee of a pregnancy to follow and the offspring from that pregnancy guaranteed to be healthy and talented) to Scouter. Scouter's lovemate since their youth, Dewshine, is welcomed to join them in their lifemating, becoming a 3-way lifemating.<\/p><p style=\"\">Tyleet has a gift for diplomacy, a peaceful mien, and excellent tanning skills (she apprenticed to Moonshade). She was not a fighter, but much like Leetah, could wield the knife when her or her children were threatened or it was time to gather food.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-208538\/","id":208538,"name":"WolfWood","issue_number":"1"},"gender":2,"id":1580,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/77\/828085-eq_tyleet_11.gif","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/77\/828085-eq_tyleet_11.gif","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/77\/828085-eq_tyleet_11.gif","small_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/828085-eq_tyleet_11.gif","super_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/77\/828085-eq_tyleet_11.gif","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/77\/828085-eq_tyleet_11.gif","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/77\/828085-eq_tyleet_11.gif"},"name":"Tyleet","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-9\/","id":9,"name":"Other"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-276\/","id":276,"name":"Warp Graphics"},"real_name":"Sohn","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/tyleet\/4005-1580\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-1582\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":37,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:26:33","date_last_updated":"2014-01-22 08:12:30","deck":null,"description":"<p style=\"\">Krim is a Go-Back warrior who joined the Wolfriders.

Together she helps them raise their son, Pool.<\/p><p style=\"\">Dewshine was one of the original 16 Wolfriders who fled the burning holt to wind up in Sorrow's End. She fought in the battle for the palace, and stayed in Sorrow's End when it was taken to the future.

She now travels with Ember's tribe, trying to kill of the warped creatures created by Winnowill.<\/p><h2>Recurring conflict with Gliders<\/h2><p style=\"\">When Tyldak recognises Dewshine, he hears her soul name \"LREE\", and inadvertently speaks this out loud in the company of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1888\" href=\"\/winnowill\/4005-1888\" slug=\"winnowill\">Winnowill<\/a>.

The Glider's leader, Lord Voll, had asked Tyldak and Dewshine to stop fighting the urge of Recognition (they are soul bonded but nonetheless find each other nearly alien, and are somewhat repulsed by their cultural differences). Voll points out the Gliders have not seen Recognition or children amongst their own for centuries. Tyldak and Dewshine mate and then part, Dewshine going to re-join her tribe and her lovemate, Scouter.<\/p><p style=\"\">In <a data-ref-id=\"4050-3948\" href=\"\/elfquest-siege-at-blue-mountain\/4050-3948\" slug=\"elfquest-siege-at-blue-mountain\">ElfQuest: Siege At Blue Mountain<\/a>, Winnowill kidnaps Windkin, and begins to muster milk to breastfeed the child. Winnowill views Wolfriders as \"tainted\" and takes it upon herself to claim the child for the Gliders by using her healing abilities to remove the wolfblood from Windkin's body. Windkin is one of the only born-Wolfriders to now be wolfblood-free (Skywise had his removed as well so he could live forever in the stars)..<\/p><p style=\"\">Dewshine is traumatized by her experience of Recognition. Tyldak and Dewshine, once relieved of the mating urge of Recognition, decide to go their own ways. They and their tribes are too different and they find themselves not compatible. Dewshine has always said \"Love is much more pleasant\" and enjoys the choice of a mate instead of the force of Recognition. Her lovemate, Scouter, promises to raise Windkin as his own and she leaves Blue Mountain to be with him. When Scouter Recognizes Tyleet, they follow Wolfrider custom of becoming lifemates. However, Scouter has been lovemated to Dewshine since both were teenagers and loves her. Tyleet views Dewshine as a dear friend, so Scouter and Tyleet welcome Dewshine into their pairing and they become one of a few 3-way lifematings (along with Krim-Skot-Pike). Thusly, Dewshine is a second mother to Pool, the son born of her lifemates Recognition.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-420268\/","id":420268,"name":"Featuring ElfQuest","issue_number":"1"},"gender":2,"id":1584,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/4\/96106-26157-dewshine.gif","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4\/96106-26157-dewshine.gif","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/4\/96106-26157-dewshine.gif","small_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4\/96106-26157-dewshine.gif","super_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/4\/96106-26157-dewshine.gif","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/4\/96106-26157-dewshine.gif","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/4\/96106-26157-dewshine.gif"},"name":"Dewshine","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-9\/","id":9,"name":"Other"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-276\/","id":276,"name":"Warp Graphics"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/dewshine\/4005-1584\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-1587\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":91,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:26:13","date_last_updated":"2011-10-22 12:24:57","deck":"Millicent is one of Donald Duck's childhood friends.

Hailing from the planet Drakulon, she was sent to Earth to kill all evil vampires. Making her first appearance in 1969, Vampirella is considered to be one of the earliest \"bad girls\" in comics.","description":"<h2>Origin<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Vampirella\u2019s origin is broken into two identifiable blocks, the portion of her original character, and that of her relaunch in the 1990s, though the relaunch incorporated aspects of the original. The original owes its inspiration to the camp science-fiction style of the 1960s such as both the comic and film version of <a href=\"\/barbarella\/4005-51868\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51868\">Barbarella<\/a>. These in turn also drew much inspiration from earlier pulp science fiction novels. The character also incorporated some elements of the women\u2019s liberation movement with a female hero, while also incorporating the sexual liberation of the period in the character\u2019s raw sexuality.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Her first origin and the one which was the only origin which she had while she was under the <a href=\"\/warren\/4010-173\" data-ref-id=\"4010-173\">Warren<\/a> imprint, was that she was an <a href=\"\/aliens\/4015-46567\" data-ref-id=\"4015-46567\">alien<\/a> from a planet named <a href=\"\/drakulon\/4020-57780\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57780\">Drakulon<\/a>. The race of aliens which inhabited this planet were known as the <a href=\"\/vampiri\/4060-58921\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58921\">Vampiri<\/a>. The planet of Drakulon revolved around two suns, and at one point one of these stars exploded, causing a massive loss of life among the Vampiri. Some Vampiri managed to survive though and maintain the existence of their race. Eventually the world was visited by astronauts from <a href=\"\/earth\/4020-57183\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth<\/a>, who had crash landed on the planet. Vampirella was chosen to investigate, but upon discovering they attacked her. She was forced to fight back to defend herself, and in the process of attacking them she discovered that they had blood inside their bodies, something which she craved. After defeating them she decided to take their spaceship back to Earth, where she discovered that her race of aliens bore a resemblance to the mythical <a href=\"\/vampires\/4015-55796\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55796\">vampires<\/a>. With the negative stigma attached to her she decided to break the stereotype by acting in a good and honourable manner.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Following the transfer of the character from Warren to Harris the character was partially re-imagined. The character was purchased as she fit in with the \u201cbad girl\u201d trend in independent comics at the time, though another strong current in comic books at the time was that of occult based stories. As such her background as an alien was revealed to be a memory implant, and she was actually part of an ancient biblical battle. Although this served to in a sense destroy her original stories, they were nonetheless kept as a part of the implanted memories. Also in this origin she is more closely tied to actual vampire myths.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Vampirella was a late addition but still popular addition to the camp style science fiction comics of the 1960s. Her first appearance was in the <a href=\"\/vampirella\/4050-2449\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2449\">first issue of the same series<\/a> that she shared her name with. The creative team on this first issue included <a href=\"\/don-glut\/4040-57469\" data-ref-id=\"4040-57469\">Don Glut<\/a>, <a href=\"\/forrest-j-ackerman\/4040-56648\" data-ref-id=\"4040-56648\">Forrest J. Ackerman<\/a> and <a href=\"\/tom-sutton\/4040-4016\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4016\">Tom Sutton<\/a>. After being purchased by <a href=\"\/harris-comics\/4010-496\" data-ref-id=\"4010-496\">Harris comics<\/a> she was relaunched in 1991 as one of the wave of \u201c<a href=\"\/bad-girl-art\/4015-43535\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43535\">bad girl<\/a>\u201d characters including <a href=\"\/witchblade\/4005-18319\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18319\">Witchblade<\/a>, <a href=\"\/lady-death\/4005-1847\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1847\">Lady Death<\/a>, <a href=\"\/lara-croft\/4005-40491\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40491\">Lara Croft<\/a> and <a href=\"\/buffy-the-vampire-slayer\/4050-6239\" data-ref-id=\"4050-6239\">Buffy the Vampire Slayer<\/a> (and in fact the artistic style was also incorporated to a certain degree at the more mainstream companies of <a href=\"\/dc-comics\/4010-10\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC Comics<\/a> and <a href=\"\/marvel\/4010-31\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel<\/a>). While some publishers (such as <a href=\"\/top-cow\/4010-606\" data-ref-id=\"4010-606\">Top Cow<\/a>) used the popularity of these characters to branch off into other genres, Vampirella was essentially the only property at Harris. Her first appearance at Harris was in the miniseries <a href=\"\/vampirella-morning-in-america\/4050-22333\" data-ref-id=\"4050-22333\">Vampirella: Morning in America<\/a>. She would later go on to be published by other companies as well, though her origin remained in line with the Harris version.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As a character that has passed between two publishers and eras, Vampirella\u2019s evolution is mostly defined by that switch. The character tied strongly into two sub-genres of the medium and was influenced by both, first the campy style and sexualized form of science fiction in the 1960s, and then from the \u201cbad girl\u201d wave of comics in the 1990s which incorporated other popular genres such as the occult. While the 1960s character was portrayed in a campy style popular to that era, the relaunch of the character in the 1990s resulted in a character that was more mainstream.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Vampirella's sexy appearance and red sling-bikini costume was originally inspired by the campy science fiction style of the 1960s, but it also suited the \u201cbad girl\u201d wave of the 1990s. The \u201cbad girls\u201d of the 1990s were defined by their moral ambiguity and violent behavior as well as their barely-there costumes. Appearing almost three decades before the main trend in the nineties, Vampirella is now considered to be one of the first \"bad girls\" to appear in comics.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Her original stories focus on her adventures but also her integration into what was for her an alien society. In order to do so she befriended a group of vampire hunters, <a href=\"\/adam-van-helsing\/4005-24250\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24250\">Adam van Helsing<\/a> and his blind psychic father, <a href=\"\/conrad-van-helsing\/4005-32640\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32640\">Conrad van Helsing<\/a>. She also befriended an old magician named <a href=\"\/pendragon\/4005-32360\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32360\">Mordecai Pendragon<\/a> who after a time took in Vampirella as his assistant. Most of her early adventures involved assisting the van Helsings, specifically against the followers of Chaos, who were skilled in the dark arts of <a href=\"\/magic\/4015-55759\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55759\">magic<\/a>. As a vampiric like creature one of the recurring themes was her uncontrollable bloodlust, something which as an agent of good that she sought to curtail. Eventually a serum was found which made her cravings essentially disappear, however there was a negative aspect to this as if she wasn\u2019t inoculated with the serum she became a danger to all around her, including her friends.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">She would later discover that her background on Drakulon was only partially true. She discovered that she was in fact the daughter of <a href=\"\/lilith\/4005-24251\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24251\">Lilith<\/a>, the first wife of the biblical <a href=\"\/adam\/4005-10790\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10790\">Adam<\/a> and the first man according the Christian bible. Lilith was cast out of the Garden of Eden and she subsequently mated with a demon which gave birth to the being known as vampires. After doing this she lived on Drakulon, which was in reality a part of Hell. She later wished to atone for her role in the creation of evil and sought redemption from God which resulted in her giving birth to Vampirella. Vampirella is then sent to Earth to kill all evil vampires.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After being purchased by Harris, this somewhat altered origin was further expanded upon and effectively her first origin mostly ceased to exist as only certain elements of it were highlighted. Her first appearance under the Harris imprint was in the Morning in America series where it is revealed that Vampirella has been missing for approximately ten years. She has been working as a teacher under the name of Ella Normandy. This change was as the result of the interference of Nathan Shroud, who served under the <a href=\"\/the-cult-of-chaos\/4060-57188\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57188\">Cult of Chaos<\/a>. He had successfully managed to alter her memories.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Vampirella eventually discovers that all is not as it seems. She is given a glimpse into her future and her past by the <a href=\"\/demons\/4015-52203\" data-ref-id=\"4015-52203\">demon<\/a> Nuberus. His intentions were self-serving though as he intended to help her only so that he could gain access to Earth. In the visions which are made possible by the demon, Vampirella sees the silhouette of a woman, but as she could only see the silhouette could not know for sure who it was (it is later revealed to be Lilith.) It also becomes evident to Vampirella that all her memories about Drakulon were fabricated and placed in her mind by her evil brother and sister \u2013 <a href=\"\/madek\/4005-59112\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59112\">Madek<\/a> and Magdalene.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This aspect of her character comes to be more in line with the second version of her original origin as she is revealed to be the daughter of Lilith, who as before is depicted as the first wife of Adam. Lilith was created by <a href=\"\/god\/4005-10526\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10526\">God<\/a> himself but was later cast out of Eden for failing to submit to the will of Adam. In an act of spite against God, she decided to mate with demons and subsequently gave birth to thousands of demons. After eventually realizing the harm which she had set free on the Earth, she decided she shouls atone for her acts and she decided to bear two new children (Madek and Magdalene) who she hoped would give her the redemption she sought. This plan did not go as she had intended though as the two instead of choosing a righteous path began to abuse their powers and decided to follow a path of evil. Vampirella was born as a last resort, to aid in the redemption of her mother by killing all demons and vampires, including her evil siblings. Upon eventually finding them and confronting them, Vampirella discovered that she was in fact too weak to confront them alone. She was captured by them and in order that she not meddle with their schemes again, they stripped her of her memories and created a new reality inside her head wherein she believed she was an alien from Drakulon. They are left alone for a time, but Vampirella eventually regains her memories and returns to defeat both of them.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Vampirella would soon after perish at the hands of <a href=\"\/nyx\/4005-56547\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56547\">Mistress Nyx<\/a>, a demon with the goal of destroying the world. Mistress Nyx was also responsible for the death of Vampirella\u2019s lover, <a href=\"\/adam-van-helsing\/4005-24250\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24250\">Adam van Helsing<\/a>. After dying, Vampirella awakens to find herself in <a href=\"\/hell\/4020-42471\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\">Hell<\/a>, but a specific part of Hell known as Drakulon. This is revealed to be the true place of her birth. It is here that she discovers her real goal was to provide redemption for her mother by destroying all vampire races on Earth. A degree of expedience was needed as Lilith\u2019s time in Hell was coming to an end. As Vampirella is transported back to Earth, she witnesses her mother being killed by God\u2019s hand.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Now back on Earth, Vampirella sets out with the new goal to protect the innocent from evil vampires and demons while fulfilling her mother\u2019s last request to eradicate the entire group of evildoers. Vampirella made new friends and allies in a various different groups including a group of warrior nuns, taking in an orphaned teenager named <a href=\"\/dixie\/4005-58661\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58661\">Dixie<\/a> as a ward and reuniting with her former ally <a href=\"\/pantha\/4005-32362\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32362\">Pantha<\/a>. Each of these was towards the goal of stop the plans of the evildoers. In this time she would also cross paths with a number of old foes and adversaries including Mistress Nyx and the <a href=\"\/blood-red-queen-of-hearts\/4005-32687\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32687\">Blood Red Queen of Hearts<\/a> as well as <a href=\"\/von-kreist\/4005-58564\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58564\">Von Kreist<\/a>, Doctor Midwinter and Lady Death, all of whom had their own plans for destroying Earth for their own goals.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Eventually Vampirella discovers that she was in fact also being used as a tool. Although her mother seemed to be working out of altruistic interest, she was in fact dependent on Vampirella for her own resurrection. With every life that Vampirella took, it provided additional power with which Lilith could use to return from the dead. Feeling betrayed and overwhelmed with rage, she eventually confronts and kills her mother.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">With her original mission now destroyed under a web of lies, she now seeks to save others who might share her own fate. This would for instance bring her up against the famous vampire <a href=\"\/dracula\/4005-65186\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65186\">Dracula<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Powers<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Vampirella is highly athletic, possessing great stamina, reflexes, and agility far beyond that of humans. Her powers greatly resemble those of a vampire. She exerts super-strength when facing her opponents and can move so fast that she appears as a blur of motion. She has a heightened healing factor, though she needs to maintain a certain amount of blood in her system or this healing factor slows down drastically. This also effectively makes her an immortal. If drained of blood she enters a death-like state. She possesses some of the weaknesses of traditional vampires -- for instance a stake through her heart is deadly -- but not others, as she can tolerate both sunlight and silver. She had the typical natural weapons -- fangs and claws -- associated with vampires. She can mesmerize her opponents if they are in close proximity and she is looking directly into their eyes. She can summon swarms of bats under her mental control, as well as generate shadows and transform herself into an intangible shadow-like figure that can fire \u201cshadowbolts\u201d at enemies. She also has minor shapeshifting abilities.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h2>Other Media<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Vampirella was the titular character in a 1996 direct-to-video <a href=\"\/vampirella\/4025-203\" data-ref-id=\"4025-203\">movie<\/a> and was portrayed by actress Talisa Soto.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Popular Recognition<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Citing her seductive vampiric nature and scanty sling-bikini costume, Vampirella was ranked 35th in Comic Buyer's Guide's <a href=\"\/comics-buyers-guide-presents-2-100-sexiest-women-i\/4000-463770\" data-ref-id=\"4000-463770\">100 Sexiest Women in Comics<\/a> list.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-10419\/","id":10419,"name":"Vampirella of Drakulon","issue_number":"1"},"gender":2,"id":1677,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/2\/29837\/4424251-vampirella_jscampbell.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/29837\/4424251-vampirella_jscampbell.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/2\/29837\/4424251-vampirella_jscampbell.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/29837\/4424251-vampirella_jscampbell.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/2\/29837\/4424251-vampirella_jscampbell.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/2\/29837\/4424251-vampirella_jscampbell.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/2\/29837\/4424251-vampirella_jscampbell.jpg"},"name":"Vampirella","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-3\/","id":3,"name":"Alien"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-1859\/","id":1859,"name":"Dynamite Entertainment"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/vampirella\/4005-1677\/"},{"aliases":"Greta Hayes\nMist Girl\nBottle Girl\nSuzie","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-1682\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":97,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:35","date_last_updated":"2014-02-22 11:50:20","deck":"As a member of Young Justice, Secret was a ghost-like heroine until she was restored to her human form by Darkseid before the team disbanded.","description":"<h2>Origin<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9541\/1198179-182069_20120_crimson_fox.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1198179\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.755\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:175.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9541\/1198179-182069_20120_crimson_fox.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1198179\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9541\/1198179-182069_20120_crimson_fox.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Secret Power<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Secret was born Greta Hayes.

Oshi was the daughter of a powerful <em>\"mambo,\"<\/em> a priestess of the mystical art of <em>Vodun<\/em> (more commonly referred to as \"voodoo\"), and though she had her reservations about Don, her mother allowed Oshi to marry him once it was known that Anita would be born. However, before that time, she convinced Oshi to allow her to perform a ritual that would \u00a0 \u00a0ask Oya, vodoun goddess of the wind, fire, and thunderbolt (who represented female power and guarded the gates of death), to \"sponsor\" Anita and serve as her <em>\"Gros Bon Ange\"<\/em> (Big Guardian Angel).<\/p> <p style=\"\">When Anita was born, she grew up in her grandmother's home before the Fite family moved to a small apartment along Bourbon Streen in New Orleans. Though she was only five at the time, Anita displayed considerable athletic abilities, able to do a handstand on their apartment's railing two-stories up with no visible effort, something her grandmother chalked up to the influence of Oya. Because of her imperious, somewhat bossy attitude, her mother called her \"Empress,\" and for a time, the Fite's were a happy family.<\/p> <p style=\"\">However, good things rarely last long. <\/p> <p style=\"\">A few years later, when Don was working for the Justice Department, he almost single-handedly dissolved the underworld organization of a local crime baron, known as Aqua Sin Gaaz, who escaped the final dragnet. Unbeknownst to law-enforcement, though whispered amongst his subordinates, Sin Gaaz was a <em>\"bokor,\"<\/em> an evil practitioner of the vodoun arts. Enraged at Fite's actions, he used his magicks to set their apartment ablaze, and Anita's mother died in the aftermath while trying to save Anita. Initially furious at her father for not being there to save her mother, Anita made it all but impossible for Don to take car of her, so he allowed Oshi's mother to take her in.<\/p> <p style=\"\">It was under her care that she was taught the ways of the vodoun, and under her care, Anita's spirit began to heal and she was given a sense of the \"loa\"... A sense of mystery. However, by the time Anita was 13-years-old, her grandmother fell ill and perished, though not before bequeathing to her an \"Emperor's Staff,\" a weapon that resembled an escrima stave, but could be split into a set of knives. She told Anita that, since Oya had taken her spirit into her keeping, that she would be able to use it as none before had. In that moment, her spirit passed on, and Anita was mystically teleported to a candlelit room upon an alter. Somehow knowing exactly what to do, she performed a mysterious ritual that required a shedding of blood on her part, the rest was a mystery.<\/p> <p style=\"\"><br \/>A few years later, Anita and her father had moved to Happy Harbor, Rhode Island, and Don had become a member of APES, partnered up with Ishido Maad. Unbeknownst to him, Anita became a costumed vigilante after watching Arrowette (Cisse King-Jones), dispatch a thief at the local mall. She was inspired by the archer's heroics, and resolved to use her skills and proficiency with the vodoun arts to help others, taking her mother's nickname for her as her costumed alias. She first intervened on Young Justice' behalf when they were framed for defacing Mount Rushmore (the cover for APES' headquarters), after the organization had kidnapped Secret as a favor to the DEO (Department of Extranormal Operations), and later became a full-fledged member of the team after her father and the group made amends. At first, there was tension between Cissie and Anita - Cissie thinking that Anita had simply wanted to replace her in Young Justice - but the girls quickly came to an understanding and became friends, with Cissie having recently given up her career in heroics to persue a more \"normal life\" due to\u00a0personal trauma,\u00a0and Anita making sure Young Justice still had someone to back them up.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p style=\"\">During her career with Young Justice, Anita finally got her chance to avenge her mother's death at the hands of Agua Sin Gaaz. Her father and Maad had finally tracked him down after all those years, and had him cornered. Then, suddenly, they dropped off the radar. Weeks went by, and though it was normal for her father to be gone for so long on missions, Anita finally knew something was up when two government agents interrupted the Young Justice girl's sleepover at her house to inform her of her father's latest case. Divining his location via a \"skyclad voodoo ritual\" at Young Justice' HQ, Anita led the team to her grandmother's old home in New Orleans, just in time to save Ishido. However, it was too later for her father. When Sin Gaaz tried to kill them by blowing up the house, that was the final straw for the team. Organizing an army of young heroes, Young Justice staged an attack on the island-nation of Zandia, home to numerous supervillains from the world over. Battling Sin Gaaz in his own mansion laboratory, Anita triumphed over her mother's murderer, and an arrow through the heart, courtesy of Bonnie King-Jones (Cissie's mother, who had come in her daughter's costume), his fate was sealed.<\/p> <p style=\"\">However, Sin Gaaz left Anita with a final parting gift. Though a bizarre fusion of vodoun mysticism and modern science, a booby-trap in the lab forced two spirits out of ghostly \"warder\" Secret (Greta Hayes), Anita's teammate, and into a pair of incubation chambers nearby. Upon opening the capsules, the team found that Sin Gaaz had been able to successfully clone Anita's mother and father (possibly to use as psychological torment for her later on). Although they were but infants, Secret's involvement had ensured that the babies had the genuine souls of Anita's parents. Their task complete, Young Justice left Zandia, and Anita left her old life to raise her infant parents on her own, with the occasional help of her \"Uncle Ishi.\"<\/p> <p style=\"\">Though she has left her costumed life behind for the most part, Anita has become \"Empress\" again in recent times, though mostly this has been to aid her friends in times of crisis. During the events of the \"Day of Vengence,\" she appeared at Stonehenge to help the other magicians and mystical beings who had gathered there to reign in the then hostless Spectre, who was gunning for anyone who had sinned greatly, or who had considerable magical power. In the \"One Year Later\" saga, she again took up arms alongside the surviving members of Young Justice to help Wonder Girl and the now reformed Hercules battle the forces of Granny Goodness and her Female Furies. As of late, her current activities are unknown, though it can be safely assumed that she is still in \"pseudo-retirement.\"<\/p> <p style=\"\"><strong><u>Powers and abilities.<\/u><\/strong><\/p> <p style=\"\">A practicioner of the mystic art of Vodoun, Empress is widely versed in the religion's lore, not to mention is proficient in many spells, incantations, and prayers that can be used to conjure up magical forces to aid her and others in times of duress. When her father was kidnapped, she displayed talents for scrying a person's location magically, through the use of \"hoodoo\" (a branch of vodoun that involves an animal sacrifice to appease the \"Loa,<br \/>\u00a0usually a chicken). Though she rarely uses these other forms of mysticism, Empress frequently employs a spell of teleportation, which she can apparently use without the need of incantation or intense concentration, nor is she impeded by the need to see where she is going. However, this ability does have its limits, as teleporting with a \"passenger\" leaves both of them physically weakened, and her passengers have been known to experience intense sensations of nausea.<\/p> <p style=\"\">In keeping with her alias, Empress has the ability to telepathically command others to do whatever she says, and they will react nigh instantaneously to her commands. This has been explained recently as being a host for a portion of the \"Anti-Life Equation\" that is sought after by Darkseid, lord of Apokalips. Although this ability is formidable, it is not without its weaknesses. Her influence over her opponent's will is not indefinite, and the effects of her powers will wear off with time. Also, those with a strong enough will have been known to resist her commands.<\/p> <p style=\"\">Outside of her mystic and telepathic powers, Empress is a skilled fighter and an even more accomplished acrobat. From birth, she displayed incredible agility and physical endurance, able to perform complex acrobatic feats with ease, while showing little to no exhaustion on her part. Her grandmother believed that this was another mystic gife from the vodoun goddess Oya, Anita's guardian. She has been shown to be capable of these feets in her later years as well, performing at nigh Olympic-levels. The daughter of a secret agent as well, Anita has been trained in various fields of martial arts, and is greatly skilled in unarmed combat. Her weapon of choice was the \"Emperor's Stick\" that was given to her\u00a0by her grandmother upon her passing. This weapon resembles a beautifully decorated escrima-stave at first glance, but it can be separated into a pair of short swords at a moment's notice.<\/p> <p style=\"\">Aside from these superhuman talents, Anita is also an accomplished singer and pianist as well.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-114866\/","id":114866,"name":"Aftermath","issue_number":"16"},"gender":2,"id":1684,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/402\/79259-114011-empress.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/402\/79259-114011-empress.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/402\/79259-114011-empress.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/402\/79259-114011-empress.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/402\/79259-114011-empress.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/402\/79259-114011-empress.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/402\/79259-114011-empress.png"},"name":"Empress","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-4\/","id":4,"name":"Human"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-10\/","id":10,"name":"DC Comics"},"real_name":"Anita Fite","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/empress\/4005-1684\/"},{"aliases":"Cissie King-Jones\r\nArrowette","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-1685\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":112,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:36","date_last_updated":"2015-03-25 21:24:45","deck":"Arrowette is one of the few superheroes to retire and have it stick.

Her father has never been positively identified, though her mother has claimed that it is Green Arrow. Cissie's childhood was spent preparing for her life's mission: to be a super hero.

The charges stuck, and Cissie was remanded to the custody of the Elias School and Dr. Marcy Money. It looked as if Cissie's super hero career was over.

But this time, the killer was on the receiving end. He begged for mercy and threw away his weapon. Cissie could have captured him, but instead she fired an arrow directly at his heart. The blow surely would have killed him if <a href=\"\/superboy\/4005-1686\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\">Superboy<\/a> hadn't arrived in the knick of time, snatching the arrow out of the air.<\/p><h2>A Normal Girl again<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Soon thereafter, Cissie quit Young Justice and has abandoned her Arrowette persona.

In revenge, a foe of the Justice Society, the <a href=\"..\/..\/wizard\/29-24415\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wizard<\/a>, cursed this child of Dinah and Larry Lance, bestowing her with a devastating, uncontrollable sonic scream.

Dinah Drake married private investigator Larry Lance, an acquaintance of <a href=\"\/james-gordon\/4005-3727\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\">James Gordon<\/a>. After the loss of her husband, a retired Dinah Lance raised their daughter, Dinah Laurel Lance, who grew up surrounded by her mother's friends and former teammates of the Justice Society. Awed by her mother's exploits as the Black Canary and the adventures of the Justice Society, Dinah aspired to become a superheroine.

Dinah also possesses her unique \u201cCanary Cry\u201d; unlike the Silver Age Black Canary, Dinah was granted this power by a metagene and is fully capable of controlling it. After years of intense training, Dinah assumed the Black Canary identity and began her vigilantism while also maintaining a day job as owner and operator of Sherwood Florist. Dinah helped reform the Justice League of America with Green Arrow, <a href=\"\/hal-jordan\/4005-11202\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Green Lantern<\/a>, <a href=\"\/barry-allen\/4005-22804\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\">Flash<\/a>, <a href=\"\/martian-manhunter\/4005-2047\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2047\">Martian Manhunter<\/a> and <a href=\"\/aquaman\/4005-2357\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2357\">Aquaman<\/a>. During her tenure with the Justice League, she became romantically involved with Green Arrow. In grief of her mother\u2019s death caused by radiation-induced cancer from the battle with Aquarius, Dinah quit the Justice League. She moved with Green Arrow to Seattle to start anew, opening her own florist shop there. Her move to Seattle, though, began a slow spiral downward in her life. Dinah had decided to join an operation to bust a drug ring, but failed. Instead Dinah was kidnapped, bound and tortured. Dinah lost her powers and her fertility from the traumatic experience. Eventually Green Arrow came to her rescue but Dinah's life proved changed afterward. She started to attend extensive counseling, and was able to recover psychologically from the events, but her relationship with Green Arrow took a turn for the worst. With years of trust issues having accumulated from being abandoned and walked out on several times by Green Arrow, she broke off their relationship after she walked in on Green Arrow kissing her young florist shop assistant, Marianne on New Year's Day. Soon, she also lost her job when Sherwood Florist was destroyed.<\/p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3042837\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111114758\/3042837-43082409.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.9754385964912\" data-width=\"285\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 285px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:197.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111114758\/3042837-43082409.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3042837\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111114758\/3042837-43082409.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111114758\/3042837-43082409.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Lazarus Pit<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The wake of her tenure with the Birds of Prey summoned by Oracle, during which even her powers and physical conditions were restored to peak after being immersed in <a href=\"\/lazarus-pit\/4055-40817\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40817\">Lazarus Pit<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">She was once offered the opportunity to train with <a href=\"\/lady-shiva\/4005-2222\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2222\">Lady Shiva<\/a>, but turned down the offer.

She then beats the League of Assassins until Merlyn arrives and also blames Dinah for ruining his only chance to rule the world. She attacks Merlyn and nearly kills him until Ollie stops her.

As Black Canary and Batman fight side-to-side against them, Canary falls prey to Mortis's powers to amplify and manifest regrets through touch that possibly drives her victims to resort to suicide, and Dinah enters a trance while Huntress, Lady Blackhawk and Dove are captured. Among the manifestations of Dinah's regrets and shame is shown to be images of Green Arrow, her mother, Sin, Craig Windrow, <a href=\"\/the-ray\/4005-2049\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2049\">the Ray<\/a>, <a href=\"\/arthur-light\/4005-3583\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3583\">Doctor Light<\/a> and <a href=\"\/ras-al-ghul\/4005-40816\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40816\">Ra's al Ghul<\/a>.

She is further taunted when she is faced with her deceased mother, the original Black Canary who states her friends have abandoned her. Eventually Dinah resists and overcomes the illusion, causing Mortis to collapse. The Calculator sends Current to bring down a helicopter that is believed to be piloted by Oracle. The explosive descent of the vehicle was believed to have killed Oracle, when in fact it was piloted by an invulnerable Hawk. In the aftermath, the Oracle ignores all calls and is assumed dead by the public excluding the few who know her identity including the Black Canary.<\/p><h4>Hostile Takeover<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4496870-2032000-junior_black_canary_birds_of_prey_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4496870\" data-ratio=\"0.51012658227848\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4496870-2032000-junior_black_canary_birds_of_prey_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4496870\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4496870-2032000-junior_black_canary_birds_of_prey_13.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4496870-2032000-junior_black_canary_birds_of_prey_13.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Black Canary VS Junior<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Black Canary and the Birds face a menace behind a criminal organization operating in an investigated building in the form of Junior, the Rag Doll's sister.

After she tells off a couple of guys, one of them slaps her on the butt, only to get his teeth kicked out. She then beats the drunks in the bar and after knocking everyone out, she proceeds to rob them. Her boss comes out and she tells him that she is resigning and that Batman is on her mind. However, after being referred to as \"Sweet Chunks,\" she kicks him out the window. She then steals one of the drunk's motorcycle and leaves, heading over to the docks to beat up some thugs. Coincidentally, Batman was also at the docks conducting an investigation of his own. Canary then fights the two thugs and easily knocks them out, also stealing their money afterwards. However, she is then ambushed by more armed men. Canary was able to avoid most of the gun shots and knock some of them out. She held on long enough for Batman to arrive. While Batman beats them up, Black Canary stands and watches as she becomes attracted to the Batman. The two share a kiss after and Batman takes her home.<\/p><h3>Justice<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/14\/148344\/4497738-91f597e3fef7fd8c91de79898be188ee.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4497738\" data-ratio=\"2.1525423728814\" data-width=\"236\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 236px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:215.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/14\/148344\/4497738-91f597e3fef7fd8c91de79898be188ee.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4497738\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4497738-91f597e3fef7fd8c91de79898be188ee.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4497738-91f597e3fef7fd8c91de79898be188ee.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Justice<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In this alternate universe portrayed by <a href=\"\/alex-ross\/4040-10945\" data-ref-id=\"4040-10945\">Alex Ross<\/a>, Black Canary is a singular character with no predecessor and is a widow.

The Black Canary is voiced by Morena Baccarin.<\/p><p style=\"\">Black Canary makes an appearance as a main protagonist in the episode titled \"The Cat and the Canary\", an episode that explored her relationship with former mentor and fellow Justice League member, Wildcat and introduced her relationship with Green Arrow in the DC Animated Universe. Here, Wildcat has lost his flame in fighting crime as he begins to realize he is too old for it. Discovering he has been fighting in an illegal no-hold spar cage-fighting arena that pitted superhumans against one another under <a href=\"\/roulette\/4005-19004\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19004\">Roulette<\/a>, Canary tries to pull him out of it before he gets kicked out of the league.

In this episode, Black Canary and Green Arrow tail Huntress and the Question in Huntress's quest of revenge against the killer of her parents, mob boss Steven Mandragora. The story ends with Mandragora arrested and Canary and Huntress's distaste for one another unresolved.<\/p><p style=\"\">Black Canary's final main role takes place in \"Grudge Match\". Here, Canary is found by Huntress to be involved in another one of Roulette's no-hold spar fights throughout countless nights while her mind is under control by use of Grodd's mind-controlling technology on her Justice League comm link, courtesy of the Legion of Doom. The fights take place at night and in her consciousness by the rest of the day she is worn out, unable to fight crime well. With Huntress tracking and following her, Canary wakes into consciousness after Huntress finally destroys her comm link, thus cutting off the signal.

Black Canary and Green Arrow were attacked by <a href=\"\/amazo\/4005-3737\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3737\">Amazo<\/a>. They ultimately defeated Amazo. Black Canary's left arm was injured during the battle, and she later bandaged it.<\/p><p style=\"\">Superboy spoke dismissively about how such training was pointless for him, as he felt his powers compensated for his lack in combat experience. Black Canary proved him wrong by defeating him multiple times all the while still trying to teach him to control his temper and his situation. Batman cut the training session short however, sending the Team on a mission. Before leaving, Canary informed Superboy that when he needed her, she would be there for him. Eventually Superboy took her lesson to heart, and after the Team defeated Amazo, he asked for her help.<\/p><p style=\"\">Black Canary attended the funeral of <a href=\"\/kent-nelson\/4005-6599\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6599\">Kent Nelson<\/a> at the Tower of Fate. Black Canary was the Team's third den-mother after <a href=\"\/red-tornado\/4005-1688\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1688\">Red Tornado<\/a>'s disappearance. After the Team ran away with <a href=\"\/zatanna\/4005-5691\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5691\">Zatanna<\/a> to find Tornado, she had her hands full calming <a href=\"\/zatara\/4005-19190\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19190\">Zatara<\/a>. After a telepathic training simulation went horribly wrong, Black Canary worked as the team's counselor, and took the time to discuss the events with the Team one-on-one. Black Canary was part of the strike team that attacked the second ice fortress. From the Super-Cycle, she used her Cry to weaken the airship's shields.<\/p><p style=\"\">Dinah and Oliver were called to the Cave by Batman, who showed them security footage of what appeared to be her kissing Superboy. She was shocked, even more so when she learned it was a shape-shifting <a href=\"\/miss-martian\/4005-41145\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41145\">Miss Martian<\/a>. She vented her anger on Oliver, who thought it was hilarious, and decided to talk to M'gann. By now, she was over her anger, but asked M'gann to be herself, as her actions, as innocent as they were, could hurt people. The conversation was cut short by Batman, who requested the Team for a mission briefing.<\/p><p style=\"\">At a Justice League meeting discussing the possibility of expansion of the ranks, Black Canary was a proponent of Wonder Woman's suggestion for more women. She also questioned whether age should be considered biologically, or chronologically, after Red Tornado suggested Superboy. Black Canary was present at the press conference about the induction of Atom, Doctor Fate, Icon, Plastic Man and Red Arrow into the League.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/40\/1651174-picture_5.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1651174\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56180904522613\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/40\/1651174-picture_5.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1651174\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/40\/1651174-picture_5.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/40\/1651174-picture_5.png\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Black Canary in Young Justice<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After the Team apprehended three escaped felons (Riddler, Mammoth and Shimmer), Black Canary assisted Batman in the transfer of strange alien biotechnology. She accompanied Icon to his induction ceremony, and was glad Rocket had found a place in the Team. After being made a slave of the Light's mind control, Black Canary welcomed Vandal Savage aboard the Watchtower with a silent kneel of obedience. She attacks the team, but is defeated after Rocket traps her in a force field with one of Robin's smoke bombs. After being bound and gagged, she is cured and infiltrated the Watchtower to free the other Justice League members. However she is captured and brainwashed again. After the final battle, she is freed from Savage's control and reunites with Ollie and Roy.<\/p><h4>Mad<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4498651-5cd535c9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4498651\" data-ratio=\"0.56346749226006\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4498651-5cd535c9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4498651\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4498651-5cd535c9.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4498651-5cd535c9.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Mad Justice League<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Black Canary appears in an episode of <i>Mad<\/i> voiced by Tara Strong.

She is in Sicily, days from turning 21 and receiving the inheritance from the murder of her family, which occurred before her eyes when she was eight years old. Learning more about her family's murder, Helena adopts a costume disguise and weaponry to seek revenge, confronting not only the men who ordered her family's death, but the assassin himself.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the process, she establishes herself as angrier and more violent than a standard costumed hero, foreshadowing the conflicts with more mainstream heroes, predominately Batman. She crosses paths with Barbara Gordon (destined, as Oracle, to be a close friend and colleague), Catwoman, and Batman, who will become partial mentor, partial antagonist during her subsequent career as a Gotham superhero. She states that her compulsion derives from the moment before her family was murdered, when she believes she could have acted to save them. The story ends with her renouncing the Bertinelli legacy of crime and \u201cbaptizing\u201d herself The Huntress.<\/p><h4>Huntress: Cry For Blood<\/h4><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-92380\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1772\/92380-133583-huntress.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.525\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1772\/92380-133583-huntress.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-92380\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1772\/92380-133583-huntress.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1772\/92380-133583-huntress.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">(in <a href=\"\/batman-huntress-cry-for-blood\/4050-6599\" data-ref-id=\"4050-6599\">Batman\/Huntress: Cry for Blood #1-6<\/a>, June-Nov 2000)<\/p><p style=\"\">The slightly retold version of her origin has her as still a member of the Bertinelli crime family except that they are based in Gotham and not in New York City.<\/p><p style=\"\">After her family is murdered she is taken to Sicily where she learns a variety of forms of combat.

In the beginning of her career, murder was considered not only an option, but often the best one. In this iteration of the character she was kidnapped as a child (aged 6) and raped by a rival mafia head just as psychological torture to her father (though this is not a constant in all the depictions of her background.) She is later taken to Italy where she learns all forms of combat from her bodyguard <a href=\"\/tony-angelo\/4005-72512\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72512\">Tony Angelo<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">The character eventually began to return to her roots, more closely being associated with Gotham (at this point her background was changed so that she had been born there and not New York City.) She was generally poorly regarded by Batman as she was willing to kill to meet her objectives, but he generally allowed her to operate albeit with some hesitation. Other members of the Batman family of characters also had negative opinions of her, most notably Barbara Gordon (though this would later change.) Conversely she maintained good relations with <a href=\"\/tim-drake\/4005-9290\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\">Tim Drake<\/a> and <a href=\"\/dick-grayson\/4005-1691\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick Grayson<\/a>, even entering into a brief relationship with the latter. Throughout her development Batman and others have continually tried to incorporate her more closely into their group of heroes, in the hopes of maybe turning her away from her violent methods. This meant for instance that at one point she was inducted into the <a href=\"\/justice-league-of-america\/4060-31815\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">Justice League of America<\/a> as it was hoped that her presence there would calm her down. She was also left in charge of Gotham as its primary vigilante during the events of the <a href=\"\/batman-legacy\/4045-42228\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42228\">Legacy<\/a> crossover. Later still after changing her methods somewhat she was accepted more closely with the other heroes. Appearing as an operative of Oracle (Barbara Gordon) during the events of <a href=\"\/hush\/4045-40875\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40875\">Hush<\/a> and later joining the Birds of Prey.

Her first lead was through the gunman, an assassin by the name of <a href=\"\/omerta-the-silencer\/4005-71613\" data-ref-id=\"4005-71613\">Omerta the Silencer<\/a>. She also knew that her father\u2019s eyes and hands had been removed from his body and kept in a separate place. Eventually she came across a street gang known as the Jade Phantoms. She discovered that they had stolen the box holding the relics of her father. She would also often meet with Omerta but was unable to apprehend, nor was he able to kill her. She eventually discovered that Donald Campbell, her family\u2019s consiglieri was in fact Omerta. It is soon revealed to her by Angelo, her former bodyguard,that he was working with another family against the Bertinellis. Helena thus ordered him out of her life forever. Soon after while on the trail of Omerta, she is captured by him and taken to Mandragora. It is revealed he needed the eyes and hand to gain access to a vault in addition to some of Helena\u2019s blood. Soon after Mandragora asks Helena to join him and even kills Omerta as a sign of his intent, but she does not escape and in the ensuing fight she eventually lets him fall to his death (though she also tried to save him at one point.)<\/p><p style=\"\">After her revenge against Mandragora, there were still things about her father\u2019s past that she needed to clear up. One such thing was a ledger, which was written in code. She was unable to decipher it so gave half each to a detective and a reporter named <a href=\"\/jessica-sharp\/4005-72748\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72748\">Jessica Sharp<\/a>. The detective enlisted the help of a mass serial killer who would later be known as the <a href=\"\/bookworm\/4005-78436\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78436\">Bookworm<\/a>.

She would once again become an agent against organized crime, this time not for any specific revenge but just as she knew the danger they posed to others. At the same time in her secret identity she was a teacher. During the <a href=\"\/nightwing-and-huntress\/4050-20240\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20240\">Nightwing \/ Huntress<\/a> miniseries she seduces Dick because she thought it would bring her closer into the fray with the other Gotham crimefighters. Her plan somewhat backfired though as she developed strong feelings for him. This romantic tension became a recurring theme between the two, for instance when she journeyed to <a href=\"\/bludhaven\/4020-55771\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55771\">Bludhaven<\/a> to stop a union associated with the mob. Their romantic tension also occasionally served as a source of friction during the romantic relationship between Dick and Barbara.

This started with <a href=\"\/knightfall\/4045-40761\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40761\">Knightfall<\/a>, then proceeded to Knight Quest and Knight\u2019s End. Following this was <a href=\"\/prodigal\/4045-46453\" data-ref-id=\"4045-46453\">Prodigal<\/a> and then from <a href=\"\/batman-contagion\/4045-42227\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42227\">Contagion<\/a> onwards Helena played a role either prominent or secondary in all of the crossovers. In Contagion she is shown trying to save a child that has caught the Clench. She later helps in the defense of Babylon Towers. In Legacy she is left in charge of Gotham while the other heroes depart to find the source of the virus. Her most meaningful contribution was during the events of No Man\u2019s Land when she decides that the city needs a Bat themed hero in the absence of Batman and so she takes on the persona of Batgirl. She uses a full mask for her face for protection but it later becomes useful as a means to cover her identity when Bruce returns. She is told she can keep the identity provided she does not fail him, but soon afterwards she does by allowing <a href=\"\/two-face\/4005-5555\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5555\">Two-Face<\/a> to gain territory in the area controlled by Batman.

Helena has to stop the Pettit from killing his own men which the Joker has dressed up in Joker costumes. Pettit is soon after killed by one of the Joker\u2019s men. It is the Joker\u2019s plan to kill hope in Gotham by killing all the babies born in the city during the year of No Man\u2019s Land. With only Helena standing between him and the group of people she has been protecting she refuses to back down despite being outnumbered thirty to one. Although she is severely beaten and almost killed Batman and Nightwing arrive at the last moment to save her. This serves as the first step on her road to retribution in Bruce\u2019s and Dick\u2019s eyes.

As a child, she saw her mother and father murdered by <a href=\"\/mandragora\/4005-55002\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55002\">Steven Mandragora<\/a>, who lusted for power. This event sparked her desire for revenge as, years later in her adult life, she would train herself to become the costumed vigilante known as the Huntress.<\/p><p style=\"\">She was part of the expanded Justice League roster as a faithful member following the Thanagarian invasion. Huntress was also among the teams sent to contain the Dark Heart.<\/p><p style=\"\">Still, even though she knew it was against the law and would not be acceptable to other members of the Justice League, she craved for revenge on Mandragora.

Huntress and Question take on the Leaguers, who inform them that they were there in case Huntress might show up. After a short fight, Green Arrow and Black Canary emerge victorious, though mostly because of Black Canary. Realizing Mandragora is gone, the four examine the house. Question picked up a key, which Green Arrow saw. He took the key, and after recognizing it as a locker key, he and Black Canary headed off to the train station. Huntress berated Question and his \"mystery man mojo\", but he revealed to her that the key wasn't the clue. He had misdirected Arrow and Canary from the real clue\u2014a shipping schedule. One freighter on the schedule was particularly interesting, as it came from Mandragora's home country. They headed for the docks, but found Canary and Arrow were following them\u2014the misdirection hadn't worked as well as they'd hoped. Question lost them by driving in the Midtown Tunnel; Canary and Arrow had to call for an emergency teleport into a nearby body of water in order to evade an oncoming train.<\/p><p style=\"\">Huntress and Question made it to the docks at the moment the freighter arrived, but found Black Canary and Green Arrow there too. The couples took on each other and later Mandragora, who proves a tough match. Black Canary hits him with her canary cry, which was ineffective, at which point Huntress draws her crossbow on him. As she is about to shoot, a boy runs up. She remembered how she, as a child, had witnessed her father's death, and decided Edgar should not suffer the same. Instead of shooting at Mandragora, she hit a pile of support beams that was suspended from a crane above them. Mandragora was pinned down and wounded, but lived.<\/p><p style=\"\">As the Mandragoras are carried away by police and child services, Huntress sees that Question had never once believed she could tell him anything about Cadmus. Furthermore, Question knew Edgar would be at the scene and trusted Huntress to do the right thing for the boy's sake. Question confessed to going along with her because he liked her, at which point Huntress kissed him and dragged him away.<\/p><p style=\"\">Huntress and Question became lovers, and also an unofficial team. Huntress helped Question break into a Cadmus terminal by fending off security while he downloaded information. However, Huntress snatched the USB drive from Question's hands and held it for ransom. Begrudged, Question agreed to a date.<\/p><p style=\"\">After that night, Question coops himself behind his computer for three days, intent on breaking the files. Huntress tries to reason with him, but after what he saw, he runs straight out. Left behind, she goes through the files as well, and stumbles upon a file in which Superman killed <a href=\"\/lex-luthor\/4005-41952\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\">President Luthor.<\/a> She thought it was some kind of simulation, and did not know it was actually footage from another dimension. Desperate to see <a href=\"\/superman\/4005-1807\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman<\/a> about this, she kidnaps <a href=\"\/jimmy-olsen\/4005-3213\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3213\">Jimmy Olsen<\/a> and uses his signal watch to attract Superman's attention.<\/p><p style=\"\">Together, they went on an off-the-books mission into a Cadmus terminal in Covenant, New Mexico.

The fight between the two powerhouses leaves a good path outside, where she uses Superman's com link to contact J'onn. He at first refused to teleport her aboard the Watchtower because she was not a member of the League anymore. She filled him in on Question's condition and Superman's fight, and earned her ride.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the infirmary, Huntress remained at Question's bedside. Superman wanted to have some words with Question, and Huntress left them to talk. At that moment, an outside force took control over the Binary Fusion Generator and fired it at the Cadmus facility in Covenant.<\/p><p style=\"\">In retaliation, Cadmus ordered an attack on the Watchtower. <a href=\"\/power-girl\/4005-4915\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4915\">Galatea<\/a> and an army of Ultimen clones made it aboard the Watchtower.

However, the Huntress came from a much different background. Helena Bertinelli was born into Gotham City under a leading family in the Mafioso. In what came to be known as the Palm Sunday Massacre, Helena's family was assassinated. She fled to Sicily where she was trained under her cousin and then returned to Gotham.<\/p><p style=\"\">As the Huntress, Helena's extreme vigilantism crossed the line and put her at odds with Batman, whom she openly flirts with. Bertinelli took on a career at Gotham University as a professor, most likely as the perfect alibi to cover for her alter-ego. Months later, Huntress was attacked by Faceless Hunter and turned with a Starro clone. She was returned to Gotham University to infect students and faculty with clones. After the invasion, she teamed up with Black Canary to capture Two-Face while he tried to steal the famed Cloak of Nefertiti. However, after that failed, she, Canary, Catwoman, and Batman infiltrated a mobster summit to try again to arrest Two-Face.

Harley's younger brother is a dead beat with children from at least two different women and still lives in his mothers house. Harley apparently sent him several large sums of money to get his life on track, but he squandered it. Harley's father is a criminal con-man, known for swindling women out of their money with his charm. Harley states that the main reason she became a psychiatrist was so she could understand why her father did what he did to their family.<\/p><p style=\"\">Harley went to study psychology, but found doing so dull. She tricked her way in to a college.<\/p><p style=\"\">She came up with a theory about being in love having similarities with being a criminal. About, how far can someone go for love and decided to use her boyfriend, <a href=\"\/guy-kopski\/4005-11395\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11395\">Guy<\/a>, as the test subject, pretending that she had committed various crimes, such as murdering a teacher, to Guy's surprise. Thinking he was looking out for Harley he shoots an innocent man believing him to be \"murdered\" professor who hadn't died yet.<\/p><p style=\"\">Guy thinks that he can`t live with the guilt, and wants to die, but can't bring himself to suicide and asks Harley to kill him instead. And she does, for love, disguising the murder as a suicide.<\/p><p style=\"\">Traumatized by these events, she begins to believe that universe is in a constant state of chaos, like Guy thought. She represses her feelings of sorrow, and feels connected with the Joker, who believes in some of the same things as Guy, and so finds a job at Arkham Asylum, demanding to speak to him.<\/p><p style=\"\">During the very first session, she shows the Joker her blossoming insanity, and obsession towards him. Joker finds this appealing, and Harley helps him escape various times, before eventually becoming his henchgirl.<\/p><p style=\"\">Eventually Harley was caught by Batman and put into a cell in Arkham - she is able to escape time and time again. During the events of No Man's Land she is finally able to escape, immediately choosing to rejoin with the Joker and help him in his crimes. Later, in another retelling of her origin it is explained that she was a psychology student working part time as a stripper to pay her bills.<\/p><p style=\"\">She lies about Joker having seduced her, and making her gradually insane, later on.<\/p><h3>DC's Animated Universe<\/h3><p style=\"\">Harley\u2019s origin was told in <a href=\"\/batman\/4005-1699\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman<\/a>: The Animated Series episode and comic entitled Mad Love. The story starts off with Dr. Harleen Quinzel working as an intern in <a href=\"\/arkham-asylum\/4020-31682\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\">Arkham Asylum<\/a>. She discovered the <a href=\"\/joker\/4005-1702\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker<\/a> and quickly became fascinated with his insane motives. She voluntarily asked for a chance to analyse him. During one of their sessions the Joker tells her about his tragic past and how his father abused him. She gained sympathy for him and quickly fell in love with him. She helped the Joker escape dressed up a the Harley Quinn. So, started her career as the Joker's sidekick.<\/p><p style=\"\">Later, Harley finds out that everything the Joker had told her was most likely a lie or scam. He was deliberately telling her what she wanted to hear to endear himself to her. This is something that Joker does to Harley all throughout their relationship. She knows this and continually tries to leave him but like an abused spouse, she just keeps forgiving him and runs back into his arms all the time. Of course Harley gets her license revoked when her superior <a href=\"\/joan-leland\/4005-82715\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82715\">Joan Leland<\/a> finds out she is the one who released the Joker.<\/p><p style=\"\">Ever since the beginning of her relationship with the Joker, Harley has played a very submissive role. She has often been used and abused by the Joker to the point where her life has been threatened on several occasions. Yet she remains faithful to her man and stands by him when things go wrong. Quinn's relationship with the Joker is one of the most complex and twisted love affairs in comics. As with all people, Joker is abusive and manipulative towards Harley, but just as often there's evidence of camaraderie, playfulness, and affection towards her. She's the only person who's managed to become intimate on such a long term basis with the Joker and, while he generally accepts their relationship, we even see the Joker's occasional moments of confusion and discomfort which results in attempts to kill her.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3470322\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111128810\/3470322-harleyqlg.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.25\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111128810\/3470322-harleyqlg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3470322\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11112\/111128810\/3470322-harleyqlg.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Joker and Harley<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\">Harley Quinn was originally created for the cartoon <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/batman-the-animated-series\/4075-17\" data-ref-id=\"4075-17\">Batman: The Animated Series<\/a> by <a href=\"\/paul-dini\/4040-42061\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42061\">Paul Dini<\/a> and <a href=\"\/bruce-timm\/4040-7365\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7365\">Bruce Timm<\/a> in 1992.

She was also in the comics that were part of the same universe as the television show known as the DC Animated Universe (DCAU).<\/p><p style=\"\">Harley was inspired by actress Arleen Sorkin, largely due to her character wearing a jester costume in an episode of Days of Our Lives. This is where Dini got some of the ideas for Harley's costume and personality. The show even got the actress Arleen Sorkin to voice the character in the show and history was made.<\/p><p style=\"\">She became so popular in fact that DC decided to bring her over into the mainstream DC universe. This Harley Quinn however lost some of the characteristics that made her so popular on the show and she was written as a much more psychotic dark character than she had been in the DCAU. Harley's first comic book appearance in the continuity of the mainstream DC Universe was in Batman: Harley Quinn #1 (10\/1999) which was written by Paul Dini.<\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><h3>Modern Age: New Earth<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1302522\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31599\/1302522-harley_quinn_00.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31599\/1302522-harley_quinn_00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1302522\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31599\/1302522-harley_quinn_00.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Harley Quinn (New Earth)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Harley's career as the Joker's sidekick consisted mostly of her being where he could not. He used her less recognizable face to get into places he could not so he wouldn't get arrested, and she was also usually a sort of field leader to Joker's henchmen when Joker himself decided to sit out on whatever they where doing. She was trusted with the intimate details of most of his plans, and as stated earlier, was also often betrayed by Joker when he needed a scapegoat. After a while Harley got fed up with Joker and set off on her own. She even started a gang of her own that didn't last very long due to many or all of the gang being killed shortly after it was formed. She also teamed up with Poison Ivy and had some run-ins with Thorn and Superman.<\/p><h3>Post-Flashpoint: Earth-0<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2232575\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/55328\/2232575-new52.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.6694915254237\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:166.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/55328\/2232575-new52.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2232575\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/55328\/2232575-new52.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/55328\/2232575-new52.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Harley Quinn (Earth-0)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">With the changes brought to the DC Universe by the launch of <a href=\"..\/..\/the-new-52\/12-56061\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The New 52<\/a> following the events of <a href=\"..\/..\/flashpoint\/39-56280\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flashpoint<\/a>, Harley has undergone further evolution, with a new look, origin and history.

Now I\u2019ll go on record for saying this, but I think that Harley Quinn will always be loyal and faithful to the Joker when he is around. But when the Joker is not around she\u2019s a young woman who is very capable of doing many things, and she is her own person.\"<\/p><p style=\"\">She appears in the ongoing series titled \"Suicide Squad\" along side of Deadshot, El Diablo, Black Spider, King Shark, and Sportsmaster. Most notable changes has happened to her wardrobe and general design, with the color scheme of blue and red replacing the most well known black and red combo. Her hair is now exposed, and changed to a half red and blue color, replacing the blonde. Overall her design has been heavily criticized for lacking familiar elements of the quirky clown, sacrificing her usual character qualities for sex appeal. The main issue with the new look is mostly agreed to be lack of jester appearance, which has initially been Harley Quinn's namesake. The only justification to the change from Bruce Timm's classic design given has been that \"People liked her look in Arkham Asylum\". No real further comment was provided.<\/p><p style=\"\">Harley's origin was tweaked. She remained a doctor at Arkham Asylum where she \"treated\" the Joker, but knew from the get go that he was lying to her. Regardless, she still fell for him, and when she found out that her superior was stealing her research for a book, it drove Harley to help the Joker escape. Joker would bring her to the chemical plant where Batman caused the accident that bleached his skin, deforming him, and throws Harley into the same chemicals, causing a similar effect on her.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Modern Age: New Earth<\/h3><h4>Harley and Ivy<\/h4><p style=\"\"> <\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1659906\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83050\/1659906-ivy_sneaks_up_on_harley.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3862660944206\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83050\/1659906-ivy_sneaks_up_on_harley.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1659906\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83050\/1659906-ivy_sneaks_up_on_harley.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83050\/1659906-ivy_sneaks_up_on_harley.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Harley and Ivy<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Joker decides he doesn't like Harley's presence and shoots her off in a rocket. Harley crash lands at Robinson Park, where she meets <a href=\"\/poison-ivy\/4005-1697\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1697\">Poison Ivy<\/a>. Ivy originally saved Harley but recognized that she was one of the doctors at Arkham. When Harley woke up Ivy planned to kill her, but when Harley did not care what Ivy was going to do as she was upset, it made Pamela curious. Ivy convinced Harley to tell her what her problem was. After Harley told Ivy about everything, Ivy and Harley became instant best friends and Ivy vowed to help her gain her revenge for what Joker put her through. She was so angry at the Joker that she even teamed up with Batman to help bring him down. She chased Joker up the building while Batman took care of his henchmen. Harley was ready to kill the Joker, but when he apologized to her, she forgave him right away and they made up with a kiss. Ivy is angry at Harley for getting back with Joker, but eventually forgives her. Harley and Ivy have a sisterly-like bond and Ivy is usually the one Harley goes to when she and Joker have a break.<\/p><p style=\"\">Harley visits the Joker in Arkham as his speech therapist while he's receiving electroshock therapy &amp; surgery after surviving a point-blank gunshot to the head at close range. The Joker decides to revamp himself &amp; kill all his links to his past &amp; be reborn in a baptism of blood, with the usual exclusion of Batman. He orders Harley to kill all his former henchmen, and she abides with no questions asked. It is later revealed that he plans on killing her too, as she is another connection to his old life. Batman steps in before the plan can go as it's supposed to and the two duke it out. Eventually, a heartbroken Harley shoots Joker in the shoulder, allowing Batman to get the upper hand and take Joker back to Arkham Asylum.<\/p><h4>After Infinite Crisis<\/h4><p style=\"\">One year after <a href=\"\/infinite-crisis\/4045-40765\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis<\/a>, Harley was in Arkham and was trying to get out the right way. She was kidnapped by Scarface and the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/ventriloquist-riley\/4005-47655\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47655\">Ventriloquist<\/a> who offered her a deal to help them both get extremely rich. Harley agreed and proceeded with the plan, however, out of respect for the older Ventriloquist, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/ventriloquist-wesker\/4005-5767\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5767\">Arnold Wesker<\/a>, she calls the police instead. Batman arrives and they both foiled Scarface's plan and after that, Harley went back to Arkham. The next day she was free to go with the vote of Bruce Wayne.<\/p><p style=\"\">After a brief run with the <a href=\"\/secret-six\/4060-38149\" data-ref-id=\"4060-38149\">Secret Six,<\/a> Harley decided to call it quits, and joined the Metropolis branch of the Athenian Women's Shelter, which is secretly a training facility for future members of <a href=\"\/granny-goodness\/4005-3629\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3629\">Granny Goodness<\/a>'s Female Furies. There she meets up with Holly Robinson, a former stand-in for Catwoman.

Thalia is amused by Harley's feistiness and grants her a small portion of the cunning of Thalia, the Muse of Comedy, seemingly appropriate because of Harley's past. Harley Quinn\u2019s costume is slightly more Greek- like and she also gained a nice new hammer to go with her new super human abilities. While returning to Earth, Harley's powers vanish.<\/p><p style=\"\">Much later, a supposedly reformed Harley finds herself back in <a href=\"\/gotham-city\/4020-23611\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City<\/a>, after receiving a large sum of money from Catwoman (Selina Kyle) for her aid in dealing with Hush. Harley ends up living with Ivy, who is slumming in the apartment of the Riddler. Ivy takes Selina to their home after rescuing her from a crazed super villain wannabe named Boneblaster. After seeing that Ivy has brainwashed the Riddler in order to get him to be passive while they use his place, Harley arrives with many shopping bags. Selina sees first hand what Harley has been doing with the large sum of money she gave to Harley. Ivy and Catwoman bring up the Joker, and Harley insists that she is over him, but she is not very convincing at all. Seeking to make a name for himself, Boneblaster followed the girls to the apartment and attacks them. Harley, Ivy and Selina defeat him easily, but the apartment is destroyed in the process.<\/p><h4>Gotham's Sirens<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1519348\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1519348-12849_400x600.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1519348-12849_400x600.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1519348\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62058\/1519348-12849_400x600.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62058\/1519348-12849_400x600.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Sirens<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Back in Gotham City Selina obtains a new living space in the form of an abandoned animal shelter and invites Harley and Ivy to live with her, stating that girls like them should stick together as a gang. Harley and Ivy agree, but first they drug Selina and ask her to tell them who the Batman is. Selina, her mind protected thanks to techniques taught to her by Talia al Ghul, gives a fabricated tale of multiple Batmen. Ivy and Harley believe her, though Harley is skeptical, postulating through her psychiatric background that a single man could be the Batman if he underwent some sort of \"severe childhood trauma.\"<\/p><p style=\"\">Harley ignores her thoughts temporarily to go shopping, and encounters a bunch of hooded thugs who had kidnapped Bruce Wayne and were trying to get away in a red vehicle. Harley leaps onto the car and defeats the thugs, in thanks for Bruce signing her parole papers in the past. Unknown to her is the fact that \"Bruce\" is actually Thomas Elliot (Hush) who was masquerading as the billionaire. She goes with him amicably as he thanks her for saving him.<\/p><p style=\"\">When she sends Selina a phone message with a photo of her with \"Bruce,\" Selina realizes that Harley was with Hush, and rushes to help her with Ivy in tow. When they arrive at the cafe where Hush and Harley took the picture, all Selina and Ivy find is Harley's phone next to a stabbed harlequin doll.<\/p><p style=\"\">Hush takes Harley to a high rollers lounge, where he secretly plans to push her off the top floor to her death. As Hush keeps moving her to darker and more secluded places, Harley is under the impression he is trying to get her alone to kiss her. Once they are finally alone and in the dark, a light pierces the darkness as one of Jokers blimps shines a spotlight on them. The henchmen then open fire on the two of them, and after dancing around gun fire for a little bit Ivy shows up and stops the blimp with her plants.<\/p><p style=\"\">Ivy, Catwoman, and Harley return back to their new hideout and Harley goes on a long speech about how Joker must still love her. Just then the Joker-mobile crashes through the window of their room. A robot Joker then steps out of the car and explodes. The girls survive, and after Ivy puts out the fire, her and Catwoman begin yelling at Harley until getting her to agree that they need to kill Joker.<\/p><p style=\"\">Once arriving at the Joker's hideout, they are immediately greeted by the Joker's gunfire. Harley almost instantly realizes that the Joker is not the real Joker, but thinking she has gone soft for Joker, Ivy wraps her in vines before she can say so. Once Harley unbinds the vines from her mouth, she states the impostor is Gaggy, a former sidekick of Joker that resents Harley for taking him.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gaggy pulls a knife on Harley and is about to cut her up, but she talks her way into some more time and gets dragged into another room. After listening to Gaggy tell the story of him and Joker, and getting strapped to a rocket, Ivy, Catwoman, and Jenna Duffy arrive to save her. It is then that Harley breaks free, punches Gaggy in the face, straps him to the rocket, and blast him into the sky. On the ride back to the hideout, Harley again vows that she is over Joker, but quickly starts talking about how he could change, until she is silenced by Ivy yet again.<\/p><p style=\"\">Harley and the other Sirens always seem to find trouble no matter how hard they try to stay strait. They have a run-in with Doctor Aesop who tries to take over their hang out. Then they investigate a missing dog case only to find out Harley's Hyenas were eating the dogs. It is at this point Harley is forced to donate them to the zoo. and then almost gets cut up by Catwoman's sister, Maggie Kyle. Harley is even possessed in the process. Then Harley and Catwoman are nearly killed by Ivy when her body is being used by a plant alien known as the Alstairean.<\/p><p style=\"\">Soon after the Sirens get a visit from Zatanna and Talia al Ghul. After separated the Sirens it is soon revealed that Talia has tricked Zatanna into trying to erase Selina's memory of Bruce\/Batman completely, because Talia wants Bruce all to herself. Ivy and Harley soon rescue Selina. After Harley and Catwoman return home the two of them reflect on their own love life. Harley suddenly leaves and goes to an abandoned Joker HQ. Ivy and Catwoman follow, just to end up getting themselves knocked unconscious by sleeping gas, by Harley-who says as she walks away \"This time, I'm going to kill The Joker\".<\/p><p style=\"\">Harley then breaks into Arkham Asylum on her journey to kill Joker. She takes out a few guards and quickly releases Clayface to break other prisoners out to cause a distraction. She then informs guard, Aaron Cash, that Joker is the one that killed his first born son. He then allows her to enter the area where Joker is being held. Once Harley sets her eyes upon Joker her mind fills with all the bad memories of him, but then the good memories flood her mind and she is instantly in love with him again, as she gives him a huge hug. During the riot Joker gets into a fight with one of the other criminals, just to be interrupted by Poison Ivy showing up to save Harley, and tells Harley to choose, once and for all, between her or the Joker. Harley makes her choice by asking Ivy what it was that she got out of their friendship, why she would risk so much. She then leans in to whisper in Ivy's ear, whispering \"Is it because you love me?\", to elicit the stunned reaction she had wanted. She then seizes the opportunity and attacks Ivy, knocking her unconscious.<\/p><p style=\"\">Her attempt to flee Arkham with the Joker fails, and she, along with Ivy, are sent back to imprisonment. Ivy escapes, with plans to kill Catwoman, but breaks into Harley's cell, in an attempt to kill her. But just as she enters the room, she sees delusional drawings of the Joker all over the walls and floor, and Ivy realizes that Harley is only suffering from a relapse, and the realization that Harley is the only person she ever saw as a true friend, and that without Ivy, Harley could never grow. She decides that she can't kill her, or leave her behind, and asks Harley to escape with her. Harley accepts.<\/p><h3>Post-Flashpoint: Earth-0\/ The New 52<\/h3><h4>Suicide Squad<\/h4><p style=\"\">A heartbroken Harley sets on a quest to prove herself to the Joker, who has at that time gone missing. Her plan was short-lived with the imprisonment at high-security Belle Reeve and consequent recruitment into Task Force X, otherwise referred to as Suicide Squad. Forced to undergo literally suicidal missions with her chosen teammates, Harley is portrayed in a more violent, relentless way than usual, having little to no human remorse and appearing to be a gleeful and dangerous homicidal maniac. It has also been noted that her skin color is unnaturally white, close to the Joker's, and indeed described by her as a \"skin condition\". It is later seen that as a part of her transformation into Harley Quinn, the Joker pushed her into the same vat of chemicals that gave him his eerie appearance.<\/p><p style=\"\">Harley is heavily underestimated by most members of her team and the Task Force X in general, which has, in fact, played up to her advantage. After learning the harsh news of Joker's disappearance and presumed death, she stirred a prison riot and escaped behind all the chaos, going back to Gotham to find the love of her life or any clues to his whereabouts, notably, his disembodied face (removed by the Dollmaker). The Squad is sent after her with the mission to bring the maniac back, dead or alive, not knowing what the sly harlequin could have in store for them.<\/p><h4>Running with the devil<\/h4><p style=\"\">The Joker is back and asks Harley to help trap Batman. Harley does help the Joker with this task, glad that he is back. But she soon realize that while he was gone both the Joker and Harley herself has changed, to much for them to be together. Harley has gained a more independent personality from the influence of the Suicide Squad while Joker is much more viscous and different than she remembered him to be.<\/p><p style=\"\">Harley and the Joker have a brutal standoff and Harley announces that she breaks up with the Joker. The Joker is disappointed with Harley's new attitude and manages to poison her, later trapping her in a prison cell full of remains of past \"Harley Quinns\", revealing she was not the first and only one in a long line. Harley manages to escape and flees.<\/p><p style=\"\"><strong>Harley Quinn Valentine's Day<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"\">In Harley Quinn Valentine's Day Special #1. She goes on a date with Mr. Tall, Dark and Brooding. Yes, you guessed it, it's Batman! How will Bruce make the night without revealing his identity to Harley Quinn?<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p style=\"\">Harley didn't start out with any actual powers. However, after a failed attempt by the Joker to blow her up in a rocket she was given a \"potion\" by her friend Poison Ivy. This enhanced her strength, speed, and agility, gave her an immunity to toxins, and a small healing factor (though this seems to vary -- later in her solo series she was shown to be able to heal from gunshot wounds in a matter of seconds as soon as the bullet was removed). She is also an impressive fighter, often using acrobatics that she had trained in as a young woman. She uses many odd and unique weapons and gadgets, such as her traditional <a href=\"\/harley-quinns-hammer\/4055-56346\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56346\">mallet<\/a>, or a large pistol with a large cork in it. Both of these she uses to surprising efficiency and they end up being more useful than they would seem on the outside. Poison Ivy gave Harley a strange brew that increases her strength and speed. She doesn't have powers far beyond those of mortal man but she really has more physical strength than any Olympic athlete. She is able to put any man to the floor in only two punches or one kick. Her legs seem really powerful, she manages to jump very high without effort -- this, coupled with her prodigious gymnastic skills, makes her an incredibly acrobatic and \"bouncy\" threat in combat, adding to her momentum with pendulous weapons such as her hammer.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2237203\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/2237203-disguise_4.png\" data-ratio=\"1.0862068965517\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/2237203-disguise_4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2237203\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/2237203-disguise_4.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/2237203-disguise_4.png\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Disguised for a heist<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\">Additionally, Harley is a master of disguise and often employs elaborate disguises as part of her crimes. On various occasions she has disguised herself as a member of a rocker's entourage, a secretary, a film executive, a police officer, an opera singer, a flight attendant and a prison guard, often mugging or tying up the victims she replaced. More significantly, Harley posed as a romance columnist named Dr. Holly Chance for an extended period, and later took on the identity of Dr. Jessica Seaborn when she decided to become a therapist once again.<\/p><h2>Characteristics<\/h2><ul><li><b>Height<\/b>: 5'11\"<\/li><li><b>Weight<\/b>: 170 lbs<\/li><li><b>Eyes<\/b>: Blue<\/li><li><b>Hair<\/b>: Bleached blond<\/li><\/ul><h3>Status<\/h3><ul><li><b>Identity: <\/b>Public Identity<\/li><li><strong>Occupation: <\/strong>Psychiatrist<\/li><li><strong>Citizenship:<\/strong> American<\/li><li><strong>Place of Birth:<\/strong> United States<\/li><li><strong>Marital Status:<\/strong> Single<\/li><li><strong>Known Relatives: <\/strong><a href=\"\/nick-quinzel\/4005-68304\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68304\">Nick Quinzel<\/a> (father), <a href=\"\/sharon-quinzel\/4005-68305\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68305\">Sharon Quinzel<\/a> (mother), <a href=\"\/barry-quinzel\/4005-68306\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68306\">Barry Quinzel<\/a> (brother), <a href=\"\/jenny-quinzel\/4005-70016\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70016\">Jenny Quinzel<\/a> (niece), <a href=\"\/nicky-quinzel\/4005-70015\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70015\">Nicky Quinzel<\/a> (nephew)<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Other Version<\/h2><h3><a href=\"\/batman-thrillkiller\/4050-45339\" data-ref-id=\"4050-45339\">Batman: Thrillkiller<\/a><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4893420-8064835785-Thril.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4893420\" data-ratio=\"1.28\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4893420-8064835785-Thril.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4893420\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4893420-8064835785-Thril.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4893420-8064835785-Thril.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Thrillkiller<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Harley Quinn appears in this <a href=\"\/elseworlds\/4045-56260\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56260\">Elseworlds<\/a> comic, which was technically her first comic appearance.

She helped him try to blow up a bunch of police officers and detectives at a banquet in Gordon's Honor including James Gordon, Harvey Bullock and Rene Montoya. She then helped Joker poison a large portion of the fish in Gotham waters. Each fish had a smile like the Joker. The Joker wanted to sell his fish and even made a commercial but it was all a ruse for a darker purpose as he poisons and tries to kill several people in Gotham. It was at this time that we found out that Harley may have an allergic reaction to fish as after she eats one she vomits off camera. It could have been because of the Joker poison in the fish but Harley said she had a problem with fish before she even eats it. She was caught by Batman both times<\/p><p style=\"\">Harley was also caught by Batman when she helped the Joker in an attempt to turn Catwoman into Cat-food. In an attempt to punish Batman. She was also with the Joker when they believed that Batman was killed by a man called Sid the Squid. The Joker gets extremely depressed at the thought of Batman being dead and the two kidnap and attempt to murder Sid. Another time, Joker gets angry at Harley for messing up on a heist, and kicks her out of his hideout. It is then she meets Poison Ivy.<\/p><p style=\"\">Harley had special relationship with Poison Ivy. They became friends more than colleagues and it was thanks to Poison Ivy that Harley acquired her enhanced strength and speed. She also became immune to many poisons and toxins, including Poison Ivy's very own poisonous touch. While Poison Ivy often takes the role of a close friend or even a protective and familiar role towards Harley, there has also been some serious speculation (or perhaps wishful fantasizing) about a sexual nature to the affiliation.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-275453\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9506\/275453-93130-harley-quinn.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5562130177515\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9506\/275453-93130-harley-quinn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-275453\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9506\/275453-93130-harley-quinn.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9506\/275453-93130-harley-quinn.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Harley and Ivy<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Harley and Ivy could not be stopped as a crime duo for a while as they pillage Gotham at will. The even boast that no man could stop them. After a while Harley started missing the Joker and decides to call him up to chat. Meanwhile, the Joker, who was used to Harley's presence, was having a hard time adjusting to life without her and couldn't even find his socks. Joker, jealous of Harley's success, tracks her down at Ivy's home. At first, Harley is overjoyed to see her \"Puddin\", but when his true intentions of stealing her money are brought forward, Harley is shocked. Ivy manages to incapacitate the Joker and his thugs. It is then, when the two girls almost make their escape until the are caught not by a man but by Renee Montoya.<\/p><p style=\"\">After being in Arkham a while Harley is released in the custody of Batman for her help in finding the Joker and stopping him blow up all of Gotham. Harley goes along with the plan and helps Batman until she gets to the Joker and turns the table on Batman. She however switches back to Batman when she finds out that Joker was going to let her the babies (meaning their hyenas) and Poison ivy blow up as well. She turns on the Joker in a way that shows she in not someone to scorn, and he is happy to see that she had the guts to kill him.<\/p><p style=\"\">Harley is later a part of a prison riot at Arkham when the asylum actually puts Batman on trial after they capture him and in a phony trial they decide to execute him. Batman is forced to fight almost all of his most dangerous enemies at one time like the Joker, Two-Face, Killer Croc, Ventriloquist, Scarface, Scarecrow, and Mad Hatter.<\/p><p style=\"\">It is after this event that Harley decides to leave the Joker and crime all together. Unfortunately all her time as a criminal left her unprepared for living a normal life. Due to a misunderstanding she snaps and goes back to her old ways. Harley goes back to Arkham but it is believed that she would be able to return again and that this incident was only a relapse. Even Bruce Wayne gives her his support that she will be able to get better. Perhaps due to her being under the watch of Lockup, Harley did not stay rehabilitated long.<\/p><p style=\"\">Lockup was was a guard for Arkham before he became the villain\/hero Lockup. While a guard he apparently tortured the inmates in a psychological way in order of keeping them in line with his fear. After he was fired he reinvigorated his mission to keep people he deemed criminals locked-up. He is eventually caught and shares the same floor as Harley where he thought he could still keep an eye on all of the inmates.<\/p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3470358\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111128810\/3470358-92._jokers%27s_millions_2.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111128810\/3470358-92._jokers%27s_millions_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3470358\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11112\/111128810\/3470358-92._jokers%27s_millions_2.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11112\/111128810\/3470358-92._jokers%27s_millions_2.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Harley in disguise<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Her positive support did not work because she ended up back where she was with Poison Ivy and Joker. She is caught looting with Ivy just before Christmas and she is caught by Batman when the Joker gets away and inherits a fortune only to replace Harley with a lookalike. This infuriates Harley. She escapes from prison with the sole purpose of punishing him. Dressing up as a cop as disguise, Harley beats the Joker with a night stick, despite his attempts at calming her down.<\/p><p style=\"\">She must break up with him after this because she ends up living with Poison Ivy again and they even team up with Livewire. Harley at first thinks Livewire is cool but soon starts to feel like a third wheel as the others think of her as a dimwit. This of course ticks Harley off and none of them work well together. They are easily stopped by Bat-Girl and Supergirl.<\/p><p style=\"\">Joining back up with the Joker, Harley had a hand in creating the hero Creeper. When Jack Ryder does a television show about the origin of the Joker he is assaulted by Joker, Harley and their three henchmen Larry, Mo, and Curly. Joker sprays Jack with his poison flower and tosses Jack in the same vat of acid he was tossed in.<\/p><p style=\"\">The combination turned Jack Ryder into the Creeper. The Creeper oddly enough also had a crush on Harley. Joker did not get jealous of the creepers advances on Harley but became enraged over the creeper stealing his act.

The Joker became infuriated because he wanted to be the one to capture Batman.<\/p><p style=\"\">When he arrives at her location, he backhands her and shoves her out of a several story building onto the street below nearly killing her. Joker then lets Batman go only to change his mind and attempt to kill him. They fight and eventually they are standing on a moving train facing each other. The Batman mocks Joker and tells him that Joker's ego saved his life. He tells Joker that he never got as close as Harley did to killing him and that she was a far bigger threat than he will ever be. Joker loses his temper and attacks Batman, who manages to throw him off the train and he falls seemingly to his 'death'. A battered Harley is then taken to Arkham Asylum. Harley decides that she is over Joker and his abuse. But the tables turn as she glances over at her nightstand to see a vase and a rose with a 'Get Well Soon' letter sent by Joker. She immediately falls in love with him again, calling him her \"angel.\"<\/p><h4><b>Gotham Girls<\/b><\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4669433-a-cat-in-the-hand-harley-quinn-02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4669433\" data-ratio=\"0.75322580645161\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/4669433-a-cat-in-the-hand-harley-quinn-02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4669433\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4669433-a-cat-in-the-hand-harley-quinn-02.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/148344\/4669433-a-cat-in-the-hand-harley-quinn-02.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Gotham Girls<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Gotham Girls was a series of animated comedy shorts starring Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Batgirl, Zatanna, and Catwoman.

Harley is much more in control in this game, as Joker's illness prevents him from being the powerful gang leader that he was before.

It is heavily hinted that she is pregnant with Joker's child at the end of the game, as a positive pregnancy test is shown beside her outfit from the first game and at the end of the credits is heard singing to a baby, \"Hush little baby, don't say a word, Momma's gonna kill for you the whole damn world\".<\/p><p style=\"\">Harley Quinn's Revenge: Harley returns in this Arkham City DLC. Burning with the desire to avenge her \"Puddin's\" death, she forms her own group of thugs, all in an attempt to kill the Batman.

Her hair is dyed black in mourning.<\/p><p style=\"\">At the end of Arkham City, there is a positive pregnancy test beside her old uniform, however, in Harley Quinn's Revenge, there are shown to be several negative pregnancy test surrounding a cradle that only contains Scarface. This implies that, if she was pregnant, she likely suffered a miscarriage due to losing the Joker.

After that Joker dies Harley still stays loyal to her heroic cause and rules the Joker clan. When the Joker from our universe shows up, she is at first hostile toward him, but eventually reverts back to her old self and allies with him. He later attempts to kill her for not beating Lex Luthor, but is saved. Enraged by his betrayal, Harley prepares to kill the Joker with his own knife, but is ultimately convinced by Luthor to let him go. In the epilogue, Harley is shown escorting the Joker at gunpoint to the portal back to his dimension.<\/p><p style=\"\">In her ending (after beating classic mode), Insurgency Harley manages to defeat Superman. Harley busts out the Joker from the other universe. They then get married. Joker playfully throws wedding cake into Harley's face. This reminds her of all the years of abuse she took from Joker.

She interviews the Joker as he speaks about someone he cares deeply for. Harleen misinterprets this, thinking he is talking about her when he is really talking about Batman and she grows an affinity towards her patient. Joker realizes this, and uses it to get on her good side, building up to her inevitable seduction. Harleen is later seen taken hostage by inmates during the Blackgate riots. She is later freed by Batman but shows no gratitude toward him. At the end, she is seen helping guards escort Joker to his cell.<\/p><p style=\"\">The online mode happens an unknown time after the Arkham Origins story.

Pamela Isley was now the beautiful daughter of wealthy parents from Seattle, but she was emotionally quite distant from them. Intellectually brilliant but shy and withdrawn, she immersed herself in advanced botanical biochemistry in college, proving to be a exemplary student with an unusual affinity for the world of plants. Unfortunately, Isley became seduced by her college professor, Dr. Jason Woodrue (who later became the villainous <a href=\"..\/..\/floronic-man\/29-24969\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Floronic Man<\/a>). As part of a twisted experiment, Woodrue injected Isley with a deadly plant-based poison, which caused her physiology to dramatically transform.<\/p><p style=\"\">Isley nearly died twice from the poisoning, and it also resulted in her never being able to bear children. A further side effect of the poisoning was that it drove her insane to the point where she believed she was the 'mother nature' of the plant world, and all plants were her 'children.' Woodrue abandoned Isley and fled from the authorities while she was hospitalized. After Isley was released from the hospital, she developed pronounced mood swings due to what the professor had done to her. She tried to resume her college career and even found a new boyfriend, but her mental state deteriorated further when her boyfriend died in a car accident after suffering a mysterious fungal overgrowth (the first manifestation of her plant-based powers). Deciding she needed a fresh start elsewhere, Isley dropped out of college and moved to Gotham City. But at that point, Isley's psychotic mentality finally overcame her. She took up the identity of Poison Ivy and adopted a revealing green one-piece costume much like the pre-Crisis version of the character. Her first criminal act was to hold the city hostage with deadly plant spores of her own creation until the city's leadership gave her a massive sum of money. Unfortunately for Ivy, this was the same year that Batman began operating in Gotham. He thwarted Ivy's scheme and defeated her, after which she was imprisoned in <a href=\"..\/..\/arkham-asylum\/34-31682\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arkham Asylum<\/a>. The encounter sparked Ivy's ongoing obsession with Batman, because he was the one man she could not easily gain control over.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5599\/202439-115958-poison-ivy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-202439\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1227272727273\" data-width=\"220\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 220px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:112.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5599\/202439-115958-poison-ivy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-202439\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5599\/202439-115958-poison-ivy.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5599\/202439-115958-poison-ivy.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">The original Poison Ivy was created by writer <a href=\"..\/..\/robert-kanigher\/26-43530\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Kanigher<\/a> and artist <a href=\"..\/..\/sheldon-moldoff\/26-19108\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sheldon Moldoff<\/a> in 1966. Because the feminist movement was in full swing, DC decided that Batman needed another prominent female adversary, especially since his first villainess, <a href=\"..\/..\/catwoman\/29-1698\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Catwoman<\/a>, was becoming more of a sympathetic character. The new villainess was given a plant-based theme, partially inspired by the titular character of the short story <i>Rappacini's Daughter<\/i>, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne in 1844. Like Hawthorne's literary character, Poison Ivy was envisioned as a beautiful temptress obsessed with dangerous plants, being immune to their toxic effects and employing them to both seduce and poison others.<\/p><p style=\"\">Ivy's creators modeled her after the famous fetish model <a href=\"..\/..\/bettie-page\/29-10633\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bettie Page<\/a>, and she was given Page's trademark haircut and Southern drawl (later dropped after Ivy's origin revealed she was from Seattle). Ivy's original costume was essentially a strapless green bathing suit covered with leaves. Her costume has become more revealing over the decades as Ivy grew more plant-like in nature and appearance with each successive incarnation. Ivy's plant theme was also expanded upon, to the point where she developed into the ultimate Eco-terrorist, pathologically devoted to protecting the natural world at any cost. Writer <a href=\"..\/..\/j-t-krul\/26-44461\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">J. T. Krul<\/a>, who helped further define Poison Ivy's personality, summed up her character with the following quote:<\/p><p style=\"\"><i>The thing I love most about Poison Ivy is her walking that line between bastion of Mother Nature and psycho Eco-terrorist. She sees herself as the hand of Mother Nature. If Mother Nature were \"God,\" then Ivy would be her \"Jesus.\" She defends the defenseless nature of the world and truly believes in her cause. Maiming, mauling, and mutilating are extreme measures, but it's nothing compared to what humanity's done to the world of nature.<\/i> <i>Ivy always sees the greater good as she punishes those who deserve it.<\/i><\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><h3>Silver\/Bronze Age<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-73769\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4\/73769-9219-70726-1-batman-shadow-of-th.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.53\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4\/73769-9219-70726-1-batman-shadow-of-th.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-73769\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4\/73769-9219-70726-1-batman-shadow-of-th.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4\/73769-9219-70726-1-batman-shadow-of-th.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Poison Ivy burst onto the comic book scene in <a href=\"..\/..\/batman-beware-of-poison-ivy-the-perfect-crime-slightly-imperfect\/37-8577\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman #181<\/a> and quickly established herself as Batman's most dangerous new villainess. In her early appearances she operated primarily through seduction and mental manipulation through the use of plant pheromones, coupled with an immunity to toxins. She exhibited few physical powers, other than the ability to effortlessly climb walls like her ivy namesake. In later appearances she began demonstrating a degree of control over plant life as well as an obsessive motivation to protect the natural world.

Ivy's skin eventually became green rather than flesh-toned and she also received a major power upgrade, with her control over plant life increased so that she could animate plants as dangerous weapons in combat.

He learned that both of Isley's parents were now dead, but the cause of their death was never explained. Meanwhile, Poison Ivy revealed that she only became a criminal so she could fund a location where she could live with her plants in peace and away from humanity. Ivy eventually achieved this by escaping from Arkham and fleeing to an uninhabited island near the Caribbean. When she arrived there it was a wasteland, but Ivy used her powers and botanical expertise to transform it into a beautiful paradise. Ivy was able to live there quite happily until an American corporation tested their weapons on what they thought was an abandoned island. Ivy survived and returned to Gotham to exact revenge on those responsible. She once again was thwarted by Batman and ended up back in Arkham.<\/p><h3>The Floronic Man<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/34588\/720068-floroivy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-720068\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.388\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/34588\/720068-floroivy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-720068\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/34588\/720068-floroivy.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/34588\/720068-floroivy.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">During her second imprisonment in Arkham, Ivy received a message in some flowers that she was going to be broken out by someone that night. Two strange but formidable women named Holly and Eva successfully broke Ivy out of Arkham and brought her to their boss, the former Dr. Woodrue, who had since been transformed into the plant-like Floronic Man. This was the first time that Ivy had seen Woodrue since he had injected her with poison, and Ivy was not happy at all.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Floronic Man made a deal with Ivy: If she gave him a sample of her DNA, he would give her a massive amount of money. He wanted to use Ivy\u2019s DNA to create a child and flood the streets with high-powered marijuana so the child could control the world\u2019s economy on hemp. Batman interrupted the plan but was ambushed and subdued by Holly and Eva. At this point Ivy decided to turn on the Floronic Man, freeing Batman and allowing him to go after the villain. While Batman battled and defeated the Floronic Man, Ivy successfully escaped with all of the money.<\/p><h3>The Earthquake of Gotham<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14751\/711694-poisonivy05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-711694\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.502\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14751\/711694-poisonivy05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-711694\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14751\/711694-poisonivy05.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14751\/711694-poisonivy05.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>No Man's Land<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Poison Ivy began exhibiting more human emotions during the <a href=\"..\/..\/no-mans-land\/39-42106\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earthquake of Gotham<\/a> crisis. She created a paradise in one of Gotham's major parks and raised orphans there as if they were her children. <a href=\"..\/..\/clayface\/29-9589\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clayface<\/a> approached Ivy during the winter to try and strike a deal with her, which involved her producing fruits and vegetables. The orphans would harvest them, and he would then sell them to the highest bidder. Ivy declined and instead tried to kill him with her kiss, but Clayface was able to defeat and imprison her and the children for six months. Batman arrived and freed her, and they both fought and defeated Clayface.<\/p><p style=\"\">Batman allowed Ivy to care for the children until the disaster caused by the earthquake was over. Ivy later came across a gravely injured <a href=\"..\/..\/harley-quinn\/29-1696\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harley Quinn,<\/a> who had nearly been murdered by her own boss, the <a href=\"..\/..\/joker\/29-1702\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joker<\/a>. Ivy nursed Harley back to health, and although mistrustful of each other at first, the two women eventually became close friends. Once the city returned to normal the city council wanted Ivy out of the park because of her criminal history. They threatened to spray her garden with RC-60 which would kill Ivy and all of her plants, as well as cause harm to the children. Ivy initially refused, but after accidentally poisoning one of the children, Ivy gave herself up.<\/p><p style=\"\">Ivy believed that her powers were causing her to kill the orphans she looked after, so she went to <a href=\"..\/..\/batman\/29-1699\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman<\/a> and asked him to help her reverse her powers so she could be human again. The procedure was successful and Pamela Isley once again was fully human; however, this proved to be short lived. The villain <a href=\"..\/..\/hush\/39-40875\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hush<\/a> approached Isley and presented her with a serum that would restore her powers. Isley, unable to resist the urge to become part of her beloved plant world again, took the serum and seemingly died because of it.<\/p><h3>Harvest<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14751\/711751-180px_countdown_37.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-711751\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"180\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 180px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14751\/711751-180px_countdown_37.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-711751\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/14751\/711751-180px_countdown_37.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/14751\/711751-180px_countdown_37.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">But shortly afterward, Poison Ivy was seen in Robinson Park, killing two corrupt cops who killed one of her orphans.

In an unprecedented event, her victims' souls merge with the plant, creating a botanical monster called <a href=\"..\/..\/harvest\/29-51260\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harvest<\/a>, who sought revenge upon Ivy.

After the events of <a href=\"..\/..\/final-crisis\/39-51642\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Final Crisis<\/a>, when the new Batman (<a href=\"..\/..\/dick-grayson\/29-1691\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dick Grayson<\/a>) took back control of Gotham City, Ivy encountered Catwoman and saved her from the assault of a new super villain-wannabe who called himself <a href=\"..\/..\/boneblaster\/29-63049\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boneblaster<\/a>. Concerned at how weak Catwoman had become, she took Selina to her current residence, which also happened to be the home of Edward Nigma (the <a href=\"..\/..\/riddler\/29-3718\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Riddler<\/a>). Ivy had apparently seduced and drugged Nigma with her plant pheromones, finding him a much more agreeable and tolerable person in that state. There, Selina discovered that Ivy had similarly taken Harley Quinn into her new sanctuary.<\/p><p style=\"\">Selina offered the idea that all three of them stay together to better survive in the new Gotham City. Knowing that the magician <a href=\"..\/..\/zatanna\/29-5691\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zatanna<\/a> had once magically tampered with Catwoman's mind, Poison Ivy decided to pay her a visit via the decorative plants in Zatanna's house. Psychically channeling herself through the animated plants, Ivy was none too gentle in her interrogation of Zatanna, binding and manhandling the Mistress of Magic with plant tendrils in order to find out if she had anything to do with Selina's weakness. Zatanna denied any wrongdoing and suggested that the weakness was likely psychological in nature. Ivy returned to Selina and was about to ask her something when Boneblaster returned and tried once more to make a name for himself by attacking all of the Sirens at once. The three women defeated him, but at the cost of their sanctuary as Nigma's apartment was almost totally destroyed in the battle.<\/p><p style=\"\">Selina obtained an abandoned animal shelter to convert into their new home. Ivy and Harley moved in, but before Ivy made a final acceptance of Selina's offer, she first demanded total honesty between all of them. Selina suddenly found herself bound to a chair with vines, and Ivy then drugged Selina with truth serum-like spores and asked her to reveal the identity of the original Batman. Selina resisted the drug thanks to a mental discipline she had learned from <a href=\"..\/..\/talia\/29-4917\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talia al Ghul<\/a>, and gave Ivy and Harley a fabricated story about the existence of multiple Batmen over the years, and that she's had a personal relationship with more than one of them. The other two women accepted this answer (though Ivy still seemed skeptical), and Ivy apologized to Selina and said that she would never drug her again. Ivy then tried to make amends by instantly growing an impressive assortment of exotic fruit for Selina's breakfast.<\/p><h3>Hush<\/h3><p style=\"\">Meanwhile, Harley went off shopping. When Selina received a message on her phone that showed Harley posing with Bruce Wayne, Selina panicked and took Ivy to Harley's location. Knowing that the real Bruce was dead, Selina told Ivy that the man with Harley was really <a href=\"..\/..\/hush\/29-9588\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thomas Elliot<\/a> (the supervillain Hush). When the two arrived at the cafe where the picture was taken, all they found was a Harlequin doll at the table, its head stabbed through with a knife and Harley's abandoned cell phone lying next to it. Hush had taken Harley captive and had brought her to a restaurant atop a tall building, where he planned to push her over the edge. However, he was interrupted by two thugs in a Joker-blimp, who attacked them both. During the battle Ivy and Catwoman arrived, having heard of Harley's predicament on the news. Hush had a chance to kill his choice of the three women and somewhat convincingly pass it off as self-defense, but instead chose to save them all by shooting down the Joker-blimp. The thugs were taken into custody and the reunited Sirens returned to their residence.<\/p><h3>Gaggy<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3470504\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111128810\/3470504-sirens06.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5388349514563\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111128810\/3470504-sirens06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3470504\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111128810\/3470504-sirens06.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111128810\/3470504-sirens06.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Shortly after Ivy and Catwoman explained the truth to Harley, a Joker-mobile crashed into their living room and exploded. The trio survived, mainly due to being protected by Ivy's plants. They tracked the Joker-mobile to the storage building where it had been kept, but were ambushed there and defeated by someone who looked very much like the Joker. Their attacker revealed himself to be the Joker's original sidekick, <a href=\"..\/..\/gaggy\/29-51451\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gaggy<\/a>, and he announced that he intended to kill Harley on the spot. Pointing out that she had replaced Gaggy as the Joker's assistant, Harley convinced Gaggy to bring her to his secret lair in order to kill her more lavishly, and in doing so bought herself more time to live. Ivy and Catwoman attempted to follow, but Gaggy had trapped the two between closing spiked doors. Ivy animated nearby plants to jam the doors, but only managed to slow them. Catwoman then called her colleague <a href=\"..\/..\/jenna-duffy\/29-67055\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jenna Duffy<\/a> (aka the Carpenter), a gadgets expert whom the Sirens had hired to renovate their apartment. Duffy arrived just in time to free Ivy and Catwoman, and the three women tracked Gaggy to his lair. This time the Sirens defeated the villain, and Harley strapped Gaggy to a Joker-rocket and shot him out of the building. Unbeknownst to the Sirens he survived, vowing revenge on Harley.<\/p><h3>South American Vacation<\/h3><p style=\"\">During the chilly Gotham Christmas season, Poison Ivy went on vacation in the South American jungle, and while enjoying the wonders of nature she contemplated her odd attraction to Gotham City and its people. Her thoughts were interrupted by cries for help from tourists, who were being targeted for assassination by militant rebels. Ivy was initially reluctant to help because no one was supposed to be in the jungle, but then saved the tourists by attacking and disarming the rebels using the jungle's powerful vines. Deciding that the rebels would simply continue their murderous ways if she freed them, she granted them no mercy, crushing them to death with her vines.<\/p><h3>The Alstairean<\/h3><p style=\"\">After returning to Gotham City, Poison Ivy encountered a formidable plant-based alien humanoid from the planet Alstair. Calling himself <a href=\"..\/..\/the-alstairean\/29-72507\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Alstairean<\/a>, he seduced and manipulated Ivy into helping him conquer the Earth so his species could colonize and rule it. Combining their powers gave them unstoppable control over the plant world, and the two proceeded to take over the Earth using plant life. Ivy's friends Catwoman and Harley Quinn arrived and attempted to stop them. Poison Ivy easily defeated both of her teammates, but Harley pleaded with Ivy to reconsider what she was doing, and asked Ivy if she really wanted to side with an alien psychopath over her own friends. Ivy considered Harley's words for a moment but appeared to side with the Alstairean. She knocked Harley unconscious with plant spores and embraced the Alstairean for a romantic kiss. But in truth, these actions were a ruse. Ivy had decided to turn against the Alstairean and her kiss was a lethally poisonous one. As the Alstairean died in agony, Ivy announced that she had been in love once before only to be manipulated and used, and she would never allow that to happen again. The three women reunited as friends afterward.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Superboy: Smallville Attacks<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Conner is confronted by his new best friend Simon Valentine because Simon has become aware of Conner\u2019s secret identity. Unfortunately, Conner didn\u2019t have time to deny Simon\u2019s claim because Parasite appears out of nowhere and attacks them both. Parasite and Superboy tear up most of Main Street Smallville until Conner kicks Parasite into an abandoned wheat field. Superboy puts an end to Parasite by using his tactile telekinesis to manipulate the wheat grain as pummeling force to knock Parasite out. Superboy\u2019s victory is short lived when Poison Ivy captures him with vines that are laced with Kryptonite.<\/p><p style=\"\">Conner tries to break free but Poison Ivy keeps him docile by showing him that she has Simon under her control. Ivy explains to Conner that she is trying to save Smallville because someone in Smallville is corrupting mother Earth but she needed Conner\u2019s help and she knew Conner wouldn\u2019t come willingly so she hired Parasite to subdue him. Conner laughs off her explanation because he has noticed the activity in Smallville. It turns out certain sections of town are being overrun by unusual vegetation. Leaving Ivy with no other choice, she seduces Conner with her pheromones thus making him a bit more compliant.<\/p><p style=\"\">Krypto arrives on the scene and he remembers Ivy from their last encounter when Hush was ruining Batman\u2019s life. Ivy asks Krypto to trust her and even though the situation didn\u2019t smell right, he allowed Ivy to leave with Conner. Ivy tells Krypto to guard Parasite and protect Simon until they return. Krypto reluctantly agrees to her request. As soon as Ivy left with Conner, her hold over Simon began to fade. Simon takes this opportunity by extracting some of Parasite\u2019s blood in order to discover weaknesses that Superboy may not be aware of and perhaps bend Parasite\u2019s blood to his will.<\/p><p style=\"\">Ivy and Conner arrive at a farmhouse that seems to be the epicenter of the peculiar greenery. Conner uses his x-ray vision to locate any signs of life while at the same time scoping out Ivy since her pheromones haven\u2019t exactly worn off. Ivy notices Conner\u2019s wanton stare and just as she was about to flirt with him, Conner spots a person that is hanging in the farmhouse. They discover old man Gilliam has a series of wires sticking out of his chest. Superboy follows the wires to a machine that is fitted with a timer which is set to go off in five minutes. Conner doesn\u2019t know what to do because yanking out the wires might kill the old man or set off the device.<\/p><p style=\"\">Ivy on the other hand, didn\u2019t care about the old man so she ripped out the wires which caused the vegetation in one section of town to die off but the old man died from post traumatic shock. Ivy loses her control over Conner because his rage and moral perspective finally counter acted her pheromones. Ivy uses her Kryptonite vines to take down Conner. Fortunately, Simon used Parasite\u2019s blood on some of his experimental frogs. Their mucus like skin emitted the Parasite\u2019s absorbing abilities and Simon controlled the frogs by via remote control. The Parasite frogs converged on Ivy and within seconds, Ivy fainted after being drained of her powers.<\/p><p style=\"\">With Ivy down for the count, Superboy decides to destroy the machine but the machine\u2019s timer reaches zero and everything within the farmhouse disappears. Conner carries Ivy back to Smallville while Simon heads back home with his newly enhanced amphibians. When Simon made his way back home, he notices a strange rock with ancient runes on it but before he could investigate further, he was scared off by a posse of weird looking farmers.<\/p><h3><i>New 52<\/i><\/h3><h3>The Dark Knight- Knight Terrors<\/h3><p style=\"\"><b>For more information see: <a href=\"\/batman-the-dark-knight-knight-terrors\/4050-53222\" data-ref-id=\"4050-53222\">Knight Terrors<\/a><\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">While Batman is tracking down the person responsible for injecting several Arkham Asylum inmates with a mixture of Plant-life, Venom and Scarecrow's fear gas, he learns that Ivy has been kidnapped.

She has incorporated living vines into her costume which she can utilize as powerful extra limbs when in combat. She is now able to hear through plants, as was shown in Gotham City Sirens #4, when she tracked her friend Harley Quinn - who had been kidnapped - entirely through plants. A recent impressive use of her power is to channel her consciousness into plant material even at great distances, growing and animating it into a formidable plant avatar under her control. She can hear and speak through the avatar as well as act physically through it. This power was demonstrated when she captured and interrogated Zatanna in her own home by growing a plant avatar from the cut roses inside the house, even though Ivy herself was elsewhere in the city.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4759\/125317-107262-poison-ivy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-125317\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.835\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4759\/125317-107262-poison-ivy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-125317\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4759\/125317-107262-poison-ivy.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4759\/125317-107262-poison-ivy.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Surviving the exotic plant toxins injected into her by the Floronic Man also altered Ivy's physiology in more subtle ways. She has far greater durability and resistance to injury than a normal human and is unusually agile, being able to effortlessly climb most surfaces much like her ivy namesake. She is also unusually strong, possessing three times the strength of a female athlete of her same height, weight, and build. She is at home in the water and is a fast and powerful swimmer. Ivy has learned a limited style of martial arts combat and can handle herself quite well in a fight, even when not using her other powers. Ivy's enhanced physiology is dependent on receiving a certain amount of sunlight, which she absorbs and converts to energy in much the same way plants do (and is part of the reason for her greenish skin tone). She becomes greatly weakened if deprived of sunlight for an extended period of time.<\/p><p style=\"\">Though mentally unstable, Ivy possesses a genius-level intellect, particularly regarding anything related to plants, and may be the world's foremost botanical expert.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Other Media<\/h2><h3>Animation<\/h3><h4><a href=\"\/batman-the-animated-series\/4075-17\" data-ref-id=\"4075-17\">Batman: The Animated Series<\/a> (1992-1995)<\/h4><p style=\"\">Poison Ivy made her debut in the first season episode <i>Pretty Poison<\/i> and became a recurring villain in the series.

In school, Pamela Isley was an environmental activist who was repeatedly sent to a youth detention center for staging disruptive protests.

As an enemy boss, Ivy usually does not engage Batman in direct battle, but instead observes in the background while Batman fights one of her monster plants.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4><strong>Batman: The Animated Series (1993)<\/strong><\/h4><p style=\"\">Enemy boss. She appears in a level called <i>No Green Peace<\/i>, which borrows elements from Ivy's animated series episodes <i>Pretty Poison<\/i> and <i>Eternal Youth<\/i>. In the game, Batman must defeat Ivy's gigantic Venus Flytrap plant in her private greenhouse. It is the only level in the game where Batman is forced to use his batarangs to attack his enemies rather than his fists. This is partly due to the fact that all of the enemies the player encounters are female (including the lower-level ones) and it would be considered abusive to physically strike them.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4><strong>The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin (1994)<\/strong><\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/5017114-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5017114\" data-ratio=\"0.234375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:23.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/148344\/5017114-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5017114\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/14\/148344\/5017114-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/14\/148344\/5017114-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ivy in The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Poison Ivy is one of the enemy bosses in this game.

Her father was an abusive and drunken man who would always quarrel with Maria, a homemaker. In her spare time, Selina took gym lessons not just as an extra curricular but to sometimes avoid the domestic violence at home. One day, as she returned home from school, Selina found her mother lying in the bath tub filled with blood. Apparently, Maria had committed suicide by cutting her wrists with a razor blade. Selina\u2019s father hated Selina because she looked like her mother, eventually he drank too much and succumbed to alcohol poisoning.

They would confront her and attempt to cover it all up by drowning Selina in a bag dropped into the river. Selina escapes and returns to the orphanage.

Selina followed the ninja into a warehouse, which turned out to be a secret martial arts academy. The ninja, known only as Kai, told his Sensei that she is an intruder and a thief and must be severely punished. However, after seeing her fast reflexes, the Sensei politely asked her to join the academy so that she can harness the martial arts skills, in which she accepted.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2287959\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/68616\/2287959-catwoman27_pyrate_p21.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.654296875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/68616\/2287959-catwoman27_pyrate_p21.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2287959\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/68616\/2287959-catwoman27_pyrate_p21.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/68616\/2287959-catwoman27_pyrate_p21.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Several weeks had gone by and Selina's fighting abilities improved dramatically but her relationship with her senior Kai was far from nice. He despised Selina (who was nicknamed \"Nehko-Chan\" in the academy) and would deliberately hurt her during training. It gave Kai even more grief knowing that the Sensei favored Selina more than the other pupils. A few nights later, a news broke up on television stating that <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/batman\/4005-1699\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman<\/a> was last seen at Robinsons Park. Curious, Selina walked to the park and caught a glimpse of the Dark Knight in action who glided out of sight moments later. She noticed that Batman was bleeding when she saw a trail of blood and it immediately triggered something in her mind: if someone can don a costume and have everyone either be happy or terrified to see him, she can do the same too. The Batman became her omen and Selina decided to become a costume character as well. She bought a cat costume using all of her savings and resumed her stealing profession using her brand new costume and ability. As she was attempting a robbery at a local store, she was stopped by a group of security guards and one of them called her \"Catwoman.\" Selina loved the name and thus, the Catwoman persona was born.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1906633\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/36052\/1906633-cat_1940b.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.73893805309735\" data-width=\"226\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 226px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/36052\/1906633-cat_1940b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1906633\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/36052\/1906633-cat_1940b.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/36052\/1906633-cat_1940b.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Cat<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Catwoman made her first debut in January 1940 in Batman #1.

As they attempt to electrify the Dark Knight to death, Catwoman sabotages the machine and chases the Joker. She manages to drop him down to the floor with her trusty whip but Harley Quinn knocks her out cold from behind. When she regains consciousness, Catwoman finds herself in a cat food factory all tied up. Harley straps her in a conveyer belt and plans to send Catwoman into the grinder but as she turns the power on, Batman interrupts her. With seconds to spare, Batman turns the power off just as Catwoman's head almost made it to the grinder.

She is intelligent, creative, and high-spirited but gets good grades in school. In the comic books, she has a fondness for harmless pranks but hates to see anyone else truly unhappy and often tries to help out any unhappy person she comes across. Sabrina lives with her aunts, <a href=\"\/aunt-hilda-spellman\/4005-1748\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1748\">Hilda<\/a> and <a href=\"\/aunt-zelda-spellman\/4005-1721\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1721\">Zelda<\/a>, both of whom prefer to ignore the mortal world and would prefer the mortal world to ignore them in return. The family is often visited by Sabrina's cousin Ambrose, a lazy jetsetter male witch (sometimes called a \"warlock\" in the series) who often tries unsuccessfully to appear trendy and stylish but whose protective love and respect for his younger cousin (sometimes called his niece) Sabrina have no limits.<\/p><p style=\"\">The character Sabrina was created two years before the television series Bewitched appeared on the air, and her first appearances seem to be more than a little inspired by the seductive Kim Novak witch in the romantic comedy Bell, Book, and Candle; for example, in Sabrina's earliest appearances, she stated she would lose her magical powers if she ever fell in love, just as Kim Novak's character states in the film Bell, Book, and Candle. This aspect of the character changed fairly quickly, and she soon fell in love with Harvey, a clueless teenage boy with an endless appetite and a sturdy personality that ignores the strange events going on around him. In the 1960s animated series, in imitation of Samantha's nose twitch in the Bewitched TV series, Sabrina began to tug her ear to cast minor spells, but both the live-action TV series and modern comic book stories tend to forget the ear-tug.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the original comic books, Sabrina was the cleverest and most worldly wise of the teenagers in Archie's world, even more continental than Veronica Lodge, and that aspect of the character has remained fairly steady. She has often helped the Archie gang more through use of her unusually mature understanding than through use of her magical powers. In the live-action TV series and the comic books inspired by it, Sabrina's common sense is usually clouded because of her magic powers.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the original comic books and the 1960s animated series, no explanation is given for the absence of Sabrina's parents, nor does the surname Spellman appear anywhere. In the live-action TV series. Sabrina gains the surname Spellman, becomes half-witch half-mortal, and is told she cannot see her mother face-to-face, if she does her mother will turn into a ball of wax. Similarly, in the original comic books, Sabrina's cat <a href=\"\/salem\/4005-1723\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1723\">Salem<\/a> is nothing more than an ordinary cat that happens to have magical powers on a par with Sabrina, but in the live-action TV series, Salem gains a voice and is revealed to be in actuality a very powerful warlock, who was sentenced to 100 years as a cat because of his plans to take over the world.<\/p><p style=\"\">Like a normal teenage girl Sabrina has gone through plenty of love interests, but one person that seems to stay in her heart throughout the whole story arc is Harvey Kinkle, a stereotypical jock who is not to bright, but has a loving, compassionate side to him. Sabrina's cousin Esmeralda, or Amanda in the television series, Is a bratty little girl, who originally did not like Sabrina, but grew to love and cherish her older cousin. Sabrina has encountered many witches throughout her life, some good, some bad.<\/p><h2>Current Events<\/h2><p style=\"\">The gang from Riverdale are transported to a magical kingdom of fairy tales after Archie unlocks a book that he finds in the forest. By being transported there, the entire gang switch places with fairy tale characters who are transferred to Earth - <a href=\"\/archie-andrews\/4005-2839\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2839\">Archie<\/a> becomes Jack from Jack and the Beanstalk, <a href=\"\/jughead-jones\/4005-1728\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1728\">Jughead<\/a> becomes Old King Cole, <a href=\"\/dilton-doiley\/4005-1737\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1737\">Dilton<\/a> becomes William Tell, <a href=\"\/reggie-mantle\/4005-7001\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7001\">Reggie<\/a> becomes the <a href=\"\/big-bad-wolf\/4005-21010\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21010\">Big Bad Wolf<\/a>, <a href=\"\/betty-cooper\/4005-2840\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2840\">Betty<\/a> becomes <a href=\"\/red-riding-hood\/4005-4581\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4581\">Red Riding Hood<\/a>, <a href=\"\/moose-mason\/4005-7007\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7007\">Moose<\/a> and <a href=\"\/midge-klump\/4005-2773\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2773\">Midge<\/a> become the characters from the Prince and the Frog, Sabrina becomes the <a href=\"\/magic-mirror\/4005-23768\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23768\">magic mirror<\/a> and <a href=\"\/veronica-lodge\/4005-2843\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2843\">Veronica<\/a> becomes <a href=\"\/snow-white\/4005-37176\" data-ref-id=\"4005-37176\">Snow White<\/a>. After the worlds are let back to normal, Archie must find the key to stop the flow of magical water from the mirror between the two which will revert things to normal. As he searches for the key, the other fairy tale characters return and fight for their roles back. Archie eventually finds the key but needs to be rescued by <a href=\"\/tinker-bell\/4005-21013\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21013\">Tinker Bell<\/a>. After he rescues her he switches things back but then finds that she is a new student at his school the following day.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p style=\"\">In the live-action TV series, Sabrina was 16 when she gained her natural ability for magic, and was generally skeptical about her new abilities. She was new to magic, and a little irresponsible. She learned how to control her powers in a generally short amount of time, and has since then learned to control her powers with great skill.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the original comic books, Sabrina has had her magical powers since birth and has grown up quite comfortable with them.  Little Sabrina often appears in the Little Archie stories as an elementary school aged witch who has her full array of magical powers, such as bringing images on a television screen to life, and already has powerful friends from the magical side of her life, including elves and a dragon.<\/p><h2>In Other Media<\/h2><p style=\"\">The first animated appearance was in 1970.
